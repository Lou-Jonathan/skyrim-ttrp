# Yokudan

Yokudan is the ancient language of the Redguard people, originating from the lost continent of Yokuda. It was once the dominant language of the Redguards before their migration to Tamriel. After the catastrophic destruction of Yokuda, which is said to have sunk beneath the sea, the Redguards began to adapt to their new home in Hammerfell and their language began to evolve, though many aspects of Yokudan remain in their culture and speech. 

Yokudan is a highly respected language, filled with rich history and tradition, though it is not as widely spoken in modern times. It is still used in ceremonial contexts, historical records, and in certain aspects of Redguard culture, particularly in their warrior traditions and religious practices.
