# Tamrielic

---

Tamrielic, sometimes referred to as the Common Tongue, is the standard language spoken across the continent of Tamriel. It is the primary language used by most of the human races, and serves as the lingua franca for trade, diplomacy, and daily life throughout the Empire and beyond. Derived from Cyrodilic, Tamrielic replaced several older languages in common use and has become the dominant language in the provinces of Tamriel.

Tamrielic is a combination of several languages, most notably Cyrodilic, which itself evolved from older languages like Aldmeri and Ayleidoon. It borrows linguistic features from many of the races of Tamriel, making it accessible to a wide range of people across the continent. The language has continued to adapt and change as the Empire expanded, though its core remains rooted in Cyrodilic.

Though Tamrielic is the most widely spoken language, it is not the native tongue of every race. Many races, especially elves and beastfolk, have their own languages that they use in addition to or instead of Tamrielic.
