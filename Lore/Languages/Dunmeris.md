# Dunmeris

---

Dunmeris is the language of the Dunmer, or Dark Elves, native to the province of Morrowind. It is a unique and ancient language with deep roots in the culture and history of the Dunmer people. While the Dunmer people primarily speak Tamrielic (the Common Tongue) in public and day-to-day affairs, Dunmeris is still spoken by many for ceremonial, religious, and cultural purposes.

The language of Dunmeris is closely tied to the worship of the Tribunal gods and the Daedric Princes, and it is often used in rituals and prayers. The Dunmer have a rich tradition of using Dunmeris in their written texts, particularly in the form of ancient scrolls, religious writings, and magical grimoires. Though it is not commonly spoken in the broader world, it remains an integral part of Dunmer identity and is still taught within Morrowind.

Dunmeris is also the language used in many of the ancient texts and scrolls found throughout Morrowind, particularly those related to the Tribunal, the Daedric Princes, and the ancient culture of the Chimer (precursors to the Dunmer). Scholars and mages interested in the history and magic of the Dunmer often study Dunmeris to understand the full depth of their culture.
