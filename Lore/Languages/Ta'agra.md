# Ta'agra

---

Ta'agra is the native language of the Khajiit, the feline people from Elsweyr. It is a language that reflects the culture and history of the Khajiit, with a deep connection to their identity, spiritual practices, and nomadic lifestyle. Ta'agra is a fluid, melodic language with numerous dialects, influenced by the region's geography and the diverse Khajiiti breeds.

The language has a distinctive rhythm and structure, often featuring fluid vowel sounds and complex consonants. Khajiit use Ta'agra for everything from day-to-day conversation to sacred rituals. It is also the language of their trade and commerce, with many Khajiit merchants using it while traveling across Tamriel in their caravans.

Although Ta'agra is primarily spoken by the Khajiit, it is not uncommon for other races to learn bits of the language, especially those living in Elsweyr or engaging in trade with the Khajiit.
