# Bosmeri

---

Bosmeri is the language of the Bosmer, also known as the Wood Elves, a race native to the province of Valenwood. It is part of the broader Aldmeri language family, which also includes Altmeri (the language of the High Elves) and Ayleidoon (the ancient language of the Ayleids). Bosmeri is primarily spoken by the Bosmer, but it is also used in some regions of Valenwood by other races who have close interactions with the Wood Elves.

Bosmeri shares a number of similarities with Altmeri, though it has diverged over time to accommodate the more forest-centric, nature-focused culture of the Bosmer. The language is known for its melodic and rhythmic qualities, reflecting the Bosmer's deep connection to the natural world. The Bosmer language has many unique words related to flora, fauna, and the cycles of the seasons, and it plays an important role in rituals and ceremonies tied to the Green Pact, a sacred covenant the Bosmer have with their gods.

Although the Bosmer have also adopted Tamrielic (the common language of Tamriel), especially for dealings with other races, Bosmeri remains central to their identity and culture.
