# Orcish

---

Orcish, or Orsimeris, is the language of the Orsimer, commonly known as Orcs. It is a harsh and guttural language, with a rich history tied to the Orcs' culture, which values strength, honor, and resilience. The language has its roots in the ancient Aldmer language but evolved over time, influenced by the Orcs’ history of conflict and isolation in their strongholds.

Orcish is often considered difficult to learn for non-Orcs due to its blunt, aggressive sounds and complex grammatical structure. It is still used in the daily life of the Orcs, especially in their strongholds, where the language plays a role in everything from battle commands to familial bonds. Orcish is also a part of their sacred rituals and ceremonies, honoring their gods, particularly Malacath, their patron deity.

Though Orcish is primarily spoken by the Orcs, some other races, like Nords and some Dunmer, might learn it through contact in Skyrim or Morrowind, where Orcs live in relative proximity.
