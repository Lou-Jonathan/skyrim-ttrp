# Dragon Language

---

The Dragon Language, also known as the Thu'um or the Voice, is the ancient and powerful language of the dragons. It is a mystical language tied to the very fabric of reality itself, with words of power that can affect the physical world. The Dragon Language predates many other languages in Tamriel and was used by the dragons to communicate, as well as to cast powerful shouts known as the Thu'um. The Thu'um can manipulate the world, summon elements, and even control time, making the language both feared and revered.

The language itself is composed of short, guttural words that carry immense power, with each word of power containing a deep and ancient meaning. In Skyrim, the ancient dragons have a unique connection to their language, and few mortals are able to master it to its fullest extent. The ability to speak Dragon Language, particularly the shouts, was passed down to the Dovahkiin, or Dragonborn, who are able to wield the power of the Thu'um.
