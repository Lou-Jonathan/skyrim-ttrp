# Ayleidoon

Ayleidoon is the ancient language of the Ayleids, the Elven civilization that once ruled much of Cyrodiil before their fall. This language, now mostly lost to time, was highly developed and sophisticated, and it remains a subject of great interest to scholars and archaeologists. Ayleidoon is known primarily from ancient ruins and inscriptions found across Cyrodiil, especially in the Ayleid cities.

Ayleidoon shares similarities with Altmeri, as both languages stem from the Aldmeri language family. However, Ayleidoon diverged significantly over the centuries, evolving its own unique features. Though the Ayleid civilization was destroyed, traces of their language persist in certain ruins, relics, and books, making it a valuable subject for linguistic studies in Tamriel.

While Ayleidoon is no longer widely spoken, its remnants can be found in inscriptions and magical texts. Some believe that Ayleidoon’s influence can still be seen in modern elven languages, particularly Altmeri, which was directly influenced by the ancient tongue.
