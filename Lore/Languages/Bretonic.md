# Bretonic

---

Bretonic is the language of the Bretons, a human race that primarily inhabits the province of High Rock. It is derived from a mixture of Elven and Nordic languages, influenced by the Bretons' history of being descendants of both the Aldmeri (High Elves) and the Nords. As a result, Bretonic has characteristics of both languages, making it distinct from many other human tongues in Tamriel.

Bretonic shares many similarities with Cyrodilic (the language of the Empire), but it is older and retains many traditional elements, including a variety of grammatical structures that are reminiscent of the Aldmeri language family. Over the years, Bretonic has evolved, incorporating many words from the languages of neighboring races, including Orcish, Nordic, and Imperial, which reflects the Bretons' interactions with other cultures.

While Bretonic is the primary language of the Bretons, it has been largely supplanted in official use by Tamrielic (the common tongue), especially in more cosmopolitan areas like Daggerfall. Nonetheless, Bretonic is still spoken widely in rural areas and is preserved in cultural traditions, music, and lore.
