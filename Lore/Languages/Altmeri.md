# Altmeri

---

Altmeri, also known as High Elvish, is the ancient language of the Altmer, or High Elves. Derived from Aldmeri, Altmeri shares similarities with other elven languages, including Ayleidoon and Falmeri. Historically, Altmeri was used in official documents across Tamriel, though it was eventually replaced by Tamrielic as the dominant language.

The Tamrielic language itself is based on Altmeri, borrowing many linguistic structures and vocabulary from its ancient predecessor. Altmeri remains a prestigious language, used by the Altmer for scholarly and ceremonial purposes, and is still taught in some regions, particularly within Summerset Isle.
