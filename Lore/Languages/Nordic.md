# Nordic

---

Nordic, also known as the language of the Nords, is the ancient and proud tongue of the Nord people from Skyrim. It is deeply intertwined with their culture, history, and the harsh northern landscapes they inhabit. The language is a key part of their identity, used in song, battle cries, and the recitation of old tales that celebrate their warrior traditions and honor the gods of their pantheon.

Nordic is an ancient language that predates the common use of Tamrielic, although it shares many similarities with Cyrodilic due to their common linguistic roots. Nordic has a distinct sound, characterized by its rough, guttural tones, and its structure is built around strong, emphatic syllables. It is often considered a language of power and reverence, used in the context of ancient rituals and in the honoring of the dead in Sovngarde.

While the Nords commonly speak Tamrielic in daily life, especially in major cities and outside of Skyrim, Nordic is still used in the more rural areas and by traditionalists. It is also a key component of the religious practices of the Nords, particularly in their prayers and hymns to the gods.
