# Dwarven

---

Dwarven is the ancient language of the Dwemer, an elusive and technologically advanced race that once inhabited Tamriel. Although the Dwemer vanished mysteriously thousands of years ago, their language, along with their culture and knowledge, still persists in ancient ruins and artifacts scattered throughout Tamriel. Dwarven is considered a lost language by many, as the Dwemer themselves are believed to have disappeared with no trace, leaving their written records and ruins behind.

The language of Dwarven is mostly found inscribed in Dwemer ruins, often appearing on plaques, statues, and other ancient stonework. The language is known for its complex and precise nature, with intricate runes and symbols that are difficult for non-Dwemer to understand. Dwarven inscriptions are often used in magical and mechanical constructs, many of which still function in the ruins of the Dwemer cities, long after the disappearance of their creators.

Dwarven is largely an academic language in the present day. Few living individuals speak it fluently, though scholars, adventurers, and archaeologists who explore Dwemer ruins often learn some of the basics in order to interpret inscriptions and understand the technology left behind. Despite this, it is still considered a lost language, with little spoken use among living races.
