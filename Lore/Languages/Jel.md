# Jel

---

Jel is the secret and complex language spoken by the Argonians of Black Marsh. Unlike most languages, Jel is more than just a spoken language; it is deeply tied to the Argonian way of life, their history, and their unique connection to the marshlands. Jel is used by the Argonians for communication, especially within their secretive and mysterious culture. 

The language of Jel is not just a collection of words and grammar but also reflects the Argonian's deep relationship with their environment, the Hist trees, and their spiritual practices. Jel contains phrases and concepts that cannot be easily translated into other languages because they express the shared experience of the Argonian people, shaped by their interaction with the Hist. Jel is highly symbolic and includes elements of body language and gesture in its communication, particularly when used in the context of Argonian rituals or interactions with the Hist.

Though Jel is mostly an oral language, certain written forms of it are found in Argonian records or inscriptions, often in the form of symbols or pictographs. However, most outsiders are unaware of the full complexity of Jel, and the Argonians often speak it in a way that prevents others from understanding its true meaning, especially when dealing with sensitive cultural or spiritual matters.

- **Argonians** – The native speakers of Jel, spoken by all Argonians as their primary language.
