# Daedric

---

Daedric is the ancient and mysterious language associated with the Daedric Princes, the powerful and often chaotic deities of Oblivion. It is a language used primarily by the Daedric Princes and their followers, and it is not commonly spoken by mortals. The Daedric alphabet, which is used to write the language, is also associated with many dark and mystical texts found throughout Tamriel, often in the possession of cultists or scholars of the occult.

The language itself is complex, with a structure that is difficult for mortals to fully understand, and it is often used in rituals, dark magic, and the summoning of Daedric creatures. While it is not a widely spoken language, Daedric is revered by cults and groups that worship the Daedric Princes, such as the followers of Molag Bal, Boethiah, and Sheogorath.

Although it is not commonly spoken by the general population, the Daedric language has influenced many other languages and scripts, especially in the realm of arcane knowledge and the occult. Some ancient books and scrolls, like "The Bible of the Deep Ones" or "The Tome of Unlife," are written in Daedric, and these texts are highly sought after by those who study dark magic.
