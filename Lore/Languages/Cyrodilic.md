# Cyrodilic

---

Cyrodilic is the language historically spoken by the people of Cyrodiil, the heart of the Empire. It is the direct predecessor to Tamrielic, and while Tamrielic has now become the common language of most of Tamriel, Cyrodilic remains important, particularly in the context of ancient texts and historical documents.

Cyrodilic is a blend of several languages, with influences from both the Nedic languages (spoken by the early human inhabitants of Tamriel) and the Elven languages, particularly the Aldmeri language. Over the centuries, Cyrodilic evolved, becoming the lingua franca of the Empire. The language is rich in vocabulary, and its syntax and grammar have formed the foundation of Tamrielic, which is now used across the Empire and beyond.

Cyrodilic is often associated with the Imperial culture, and it is taught in schools across the Empire. However, it is largely considered a language of the past, with Tamrielic now taking its place as the language of the common people. Nonetheless, Cyrodilic continues to be used in official government, legal, and scholarly contexts.
