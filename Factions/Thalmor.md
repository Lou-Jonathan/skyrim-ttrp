## Info

The **Thalmor** is the combined government of the third [Aldmeri Dominion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmeri_Dominion "Lore:Aldmeri Dominion") and according to [Ondolemar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ondolemar "Skyrim:Ondolemar") represents an alliance between [Altmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:High_Elf "Skyrim:High Elf") and [Bosmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Wood_Elf "Skyrim:Wood Elf") regents. A militarist regime founded on beliefs of racial supremacy, the Thalmor seek to advance their power and influence across [Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel "Lore:Tamriel") with the specific intent of establishing the racial superiority of [Mer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mer "Lore:Mer") over Man, "_one century at a time_".

By [4E 201](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fourth_Era#4E_201 "Lore:Fourth Era"), the Thalmor has established a significant presence in [Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim "Lore:Skyrim")'s [Haafingar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Haafingar "Skyrim:Haafingar") hold, including an [embassy](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thalmor_Embassy "Skyrim:Thalmor Embassy") in the mountains overlooking [Solitude](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Solitude "Skyrim:Solitude"), a fort known as [Northwatch Keep](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Northwatch_Keep "Skyrim:Northwatch Keep") (used as a covert detainment center for their political prisoners), and an [unused building](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thalmor_Headquarters "Skyrim:Thalmor Headquarters") within Solitude which was set aside for the Thalmor by the [Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Third_Empire "Lore:Third Empire"). Thalmor Justiciars can also be found traveling the roads of Skyrim, sometimes with a [Nord](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord "Lore:Nord") prisoner in tow, and engaging [Stormcloaks](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Stormcloaks "Skyrim:Stormcloaks") in combat as part of a random encounter. While not immediately hostile to you, conversing with them will reveal their antagonistic nature and choosing certain dialogue options (particularly on the topic of [Talos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Talos "Lore:Talos") worship) can turn them hostile toward you. Thalmor death squads may also [track you down](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:World_Interactions#Thalmor_vs_Player "Skyrim:World Interactions") in the wilds, proclaiming "_Behold the future! Behold the Thalmor!_" as they attack.
