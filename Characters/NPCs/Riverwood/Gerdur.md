## Info
---
Gerdur is a Nord lumberjack in Riverwood. She runs the mill with her husband, Hod, and they have a son, Frodnar. Her family founded Riverwood, and has lived there for many generations. She is the sister of Ralof, and, like him, a staunch Stormcloak supporter. She holds some low level items in her inventory, which you can take if you went with Ralof and you ask her for assistance.

She wakes up at 7am and goes to the mill to start her workday, which lasts for 12 hours. She returns home at 9am, 10am, and 11am for half an hour, then goes back to her worksite. At noon, she has a one-hour lunch back home. She visits the local blacksmith, Alvor, at 2pm for half an hour. At 3pm and 4pm she again returns home for half an hour. At 7pm her workday ends and she heads back home to eat dinner for one hour. She goes to bed at 10pm.

She wears farm clothes, boots and gloves. She carries the key to her house as well as common items and gold. She wields an iron dagger.
