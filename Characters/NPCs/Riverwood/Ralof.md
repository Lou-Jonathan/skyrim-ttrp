## Info
---
Ralof is a Nord barbarian, a member of the Stormcloaks, and an early companion. Captured alongside you, he escapes Imperial custody when Alduin attacks Helgen. If you follow him into Helgen Keep for shelter from the attack, he frees you from your bindings so you can assist him against the Imperial soldiers.

After escaping from Helgen, he takes you to [[Riverwood]], where his sister [[Gerdur]] lives. He will also invite you to join the [[Stormcloak]] Rebellion. Once you complete the quest Unbound, you and Ralof will split up. However, if you decide to join the Stormcloaks, he will fight alongside you and your fellow Stormcloaks in the Battle for Whiterun.

You will meet him again when you are tasked with rescuing prisoners from Fort Neugrad, where you learn that Ralof has been promoted and is commanding the troops that will be aiding you in this quest. You will also see Ralof during the quest Compelling Tribute, when you and his soldiers attack an Imperial cart filled with silver and weapons. In battle, Ralof uses his iron war axe and longbow with iron arrows during Unbound, and later on an iron warhammer.

Ralof's sister0 [[Gerdur]] is a Nord lumberjack in Riverwood, and runs the sawmill with her husband, [[Hod]]. Gerdur and Ralof's family founded Riverwood, and have lived there for many generations. Gerdur and Hod have a son, [Frodnar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frodnar), and a dog, [Stump](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Stump "Skyrim:Stump"). Like Ralof, the entire family are staunch Stormcloak supporters.

After the war is over, Ralof can be found living in Riverwood at the [[Sleeping Giant Inn]].
