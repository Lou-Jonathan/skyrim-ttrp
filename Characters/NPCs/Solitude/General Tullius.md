## Info
---
**General Tullius** is an [Imperial](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Imperial "Skyrim:Imperial") General of the [Legion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Imperial_Legion "Skyrim:Imperial Legion"). Originally from [Cyrodiil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil "Lore:Cyrodiil"), he was appointed Military Governor of [Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim "Lore:Skyrim") and tasked with crushing the [Stormcloak Rebellion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Stormcloak_Rebellion "Skyrim:Stormcloak Rebellion"). Tullius firmly believes that [Ulfric Stormcloak](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ulfric_Stormcloak "Skyrim:Ulfric Stormcloak") and his rebellion are a threat to the [Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire "Lore:Empire") which has to be eradicated, and that Ulfric is nothing more than a power-hungry usurper. Among supporters of the Empire, Tullius is commonly regarded as their best hope for victory. A very taciturn and serious man, he initially holds little interest in [Nordic](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nord "Skyrim:Nord") culture, viewing it as nonsense, but eventually he learns to respect it. Tullius also despises the [Thalmor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thalmor "Skyrim:Thalmor"), and believes the Stormcloak Rebellion is a mere interlude in the Empire's real conflict with the [Aldmeri Dominion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmeri_Dominion "Lore:Aldmeri Dominion"), even going so far as to remark that they almost make him want to throw in with the Stormcloaks. He believes the entire rebellion can be blamed on the Thalmor, who stirred it up to force the Empire to waste precious resources and soldiers.

For more information, see the [main lore article](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tullius "Lore:Tullius").

The General is first encountered during [Alduin](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alduin "Skyrim:Alduin")'s attack on [Helgen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Helgen "Skyrim:Helgen"). He then relocates to [Castle Dour](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Castle_Dour "Skyrim:Castle Dour") in [Solitude](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Solitude "Skyrim:Solitude"). Depending on your actions, he may also appear at [Windhelm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Windhelm "Skyrim:Windhelm") (on one occasion) or he may be killed.

Tullius wears a unique armor piece: [General Tullius' Armor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:General_Tullius%27_Armor "Skyrim:General Tullius' Armor"), along with [Imperial light boots](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Imperial_Light_Boots "Skyrim:Imperial Light Boots") and [light bracers](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Imperial_Light_Bracers "Skyrim:Imperial Light Bracers"). He defends himself with an [Imperial sword](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Imperial_Sword "Skyrim:Imperial Sword") and [bow](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Imperial_Bow "Skyrim:Imperial Bow"), supplemented by twenty [steel arrows](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Steel_Arrow "Skyrim:Steel Arrow"). He also carries a [belted tunic](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Belted_Tunic "Skyrim:Belted Tunic").
