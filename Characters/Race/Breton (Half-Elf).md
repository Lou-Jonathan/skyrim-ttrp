Bretons are a race of mixed human and elven ancestry, hailing from the province of High Rock. Known for their keen intellect and abstract thinking, they are naturally gifted in the arcane arts and possess a remarkable resistance to magic. Their heritage may include Aldmer blood, further amplifying their magical prowess. While they lack distinct physical traits, their cultural emphasis on magic and scholarship sets them apart in Tamriel.  

## Culture

---  

### High Rock Society

High Rock is home to a feudal society, with noble houses ruling over various regions. Bretons often engage in pursuits that emphasize learning and refinement, such as magic, art, and diplomacy. Many Bretons are devout followers of the Divines, particularly Julianos, the god of wisdom and logic.  

### Bretons in Skyrim

Bretons are a minority in Skyrim, with many adopting city life as scholars, court wizards, or merchants. Some study magic at the College of Winterhold, while others find work as traders or craftsmen. Despite their small numbers, Bretons' magical expertise often earns them respect and influence in Nord society.  

### The Reachmen  

The Reachmen are an offshoot of Breton society, residing in the rugged Reach region. Known for their wild and barbaric ways, they have long been at odds with the Nords. Twenty years before the events of *Skyrim*, the Reachmen seized Markarth in a rebellion but were ultimately ousted by Ulfric Stormcloak. Their culture often involves dark rituals and worship of Daedra, further alienating them from other Bretons and the people of Skyrim.
