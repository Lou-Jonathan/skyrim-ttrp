The Bosmer, commonly known as Wood Elves, are the elven people of Valenwood. They live in harmony with nature, preferring a simple existence close to the land and its creatures. Renowned as the finest archers in all of Tamriel, they possess unmatched skill in commanding wild animals. Their agility and stealth make them exceptional scouts and thieves.  

## Fourth Era History  

---  

### The Aldmeri Dominion  

After the War of the Blue Divide in the Third Era, where the Altmer defeated the Bosmer in Valenwood, the two races became the foundation of the newly-formed **Aldmeri Dominion** and its Thalmor forces. The Dominion nearly crushed the Empire during the Great War, but its forces were forced to withdraw after the Battle of the Red Ring.  

The Third Aldmeri Dominion experienced a resurgence in prestige and power unseen since the First Aldmeri Dominion's defeat by Tiber Septim in the Second Era. Emboldened, it expanded its influence across Tamriel, including Skyrim, while maintaining strained diplomatic relations with the weakened Mede Empire.  

### The Thalmor's Influence  

The Thalmor's presence caused widespread unrest, including in Valenwood, where families loyal to the Empire suffered greatly. Malborn, a Bosmer encountered during the *Diplomatic Immunity* quest, aids the Dragonborn against the Thalmor in part due to his family being killed by them. This implies the existence of Imperial sympathizers among the Bosmer, despite their forced allegiance to the Dominion.
