The Dunmer, commonly known as Dark Elves, are a race of gray-skinned elves native to the province of Morrowind. Renowned for their fiery red eyes and adeptness in both magic and combat, they hold a unique position in Tamrielic history and culture. After the catastrophic eruption of Red Mountain, many Dunmer sought refuge in other provinces, including Skyrim, where they often face prejudice due to their elven heritage and status as displaced people. Despite adversity, they continue to thrive as skilled mages, merchants, and warriors.  

## Biology

Dunmer are characterized by their ashen-gray skin tones, which can vary from bluish hues to greenish undertones, and their distinctive glowing red eyes. Their lithe builds and sharp features reflect their elven ancestry, while their physical and magical resilience speaks to their harsh homeland of Morrowind.

## History

### Migration: Red Mountain Eruption  

The eruption of Red Mountain marked a turning point for the Dunmer. This catastrophic event devastated much of Morrowind, forcing many to flee to other provinces. In Skyrim, some found refuge in Windhelm, although they encountered hostility and discrimination. Others, especially those skilled in magic, joined the College of Winterhold, finding solace in their magical studies.  

### Azura's Vision  

Before the Red Mountain's eruption, Azura, one of the Dunmer's revered Daedric Princes, granted visions to her faithful. These visions warned of the impending disaster. Several Dunmer heeded this divine warning and sought refuge in Skyrim, where they constructed the Shrine of Azura. Although the shrine now stands as a relic of their faith, only one priestess, Aranea Ienith, remains to honor Azura's legacy.
