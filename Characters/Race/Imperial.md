Natives of the cosmopolitan province of Cyrodiil, the Imperials are renowned for their discipline, wealth, and diplomacy. Known for their well-trained armies and effective governance, the Imperials have established themselves as a dominant force in Tamriel, ruling over the continent for more than two millennia.

## Biology and Culture  

___  

Imperials typically have fair to swarthy skin, distinguishing them from the fairer Bretons and Nords and the darker-skinned Redguards. Their facial features are slightly sharper compared to other human races. Beyond their physical traits, Imperials are celebrated for their adaptability, resourcefulness, and mastery of diplomacy, which has enabled them to thrive in various professions, from traders and diplomats to soldiers and craftsmen.  

### Ethnic Divisions  

The term "Imperial Race" encompasses two main ethno-cultural groups:  
- **Nibeneans:** Centered around the Nibenay Basin, they reflect a blend of Aldmeri, Akaviri, and Ayleid cultural influences.  
- **Colovians:** Found in the western regions of Cyrodiil, they are more rugged and independent, influenced by Nordic traditions.  

Both groups share a heritage rooted in the ancient Nedic and Cyro-Nordic peoples who were once enslaved by the Ayleids. These divisions, while distinct, collectively define the rich and diverse culture of the Empire.
