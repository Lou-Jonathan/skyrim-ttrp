Enigmatic and intelligent, the Argonians are experts at guerrilla warfare, and their natural abilities suit their swampy homeland, Black Marsh. They have developed immunities to the diseases that have doomed many would-be explorers in the region, and they are capable of easily exploring underwater locations due to their ability to breathe underwater. Argonians make proficient thieves, as they have a natural knack for lockpicking.

## Culture

---
### Politics

After the conquest of the Dunmer province of Morrowind, little is known about the politics of the Argonians in the Fourth Era. There is an Argonian political faction called the **An-Xileel**, but there is little information about them, except that they are composed of mostly, if not all, Argonians, and that they pushed back Mehrunes Dagon's forces during the Oblivion Crisis in Black Marsh. They were also the faction responsible for orchestrating the conquest of Morrowind.

### Assemblage

In Windhelm, Argonians are sequestered from the predominantly Nordic population and are forced to live at the **Argonian Assemblage**, located at the city docks. After the mass exodus of Dunmer and Argonian peoples to Windhelm, the citizens became suspicious, worrying that the immigrants would influence or otherwise dilute their culture, and so forced them into segregation. This behavior, though initially politically motivated, devolved into blatant racism.

### Marriage

Unlike the citizens of Skyrim, who prefer to marry using an Amulet of Mara, some Argonians adhere to their native marriage traditions. In Black Marsh, it is customary to present a lover with an **Argonian Wedding Band**, crafted by the courting member. Each ring is unique and has personal meaning to the creator and recipient.  

> _"In Black Marsh, tradition dictates we present a potential mate a unique wedding ring to represent our future bond."_  
>  
> _"Every Argonian wedding proposal band is supposed to have three flawless amethysts as part of their design. Two of the gems, the ones on the outside, represent the couple to be married... one for the husband, one for the wife. The amethyst in the center represents The Hist, the entity that all Argonians consider a sacred part of our lives."_ â€“ Talen-Jei
