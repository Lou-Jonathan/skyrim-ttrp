*"Victory... or Sovngarde!"*

Nords are a proud and resilient race of humans from the icy lands of Skyrim, once hailing from Atmora, a northern continent now long abandoned. They are a fierce and hardy people, known for their exceptional resistance to cold, whether from the natural chill of Skyrim's rugged landscapes or the magical frost that can freeze even the heart. Nords have a deep connection to the sea, having migrated to Tamriel in ancient times by ship, and their naval prowess remains a key part of their culture. 

Nords are infamous for their battle cries, which can send enemies fleeing in fear, and they are often found as mercenaries, soldiers, and sailors across Tamriel. They value honor and glory above all else, with an unwavering commitment to their family and their land. They worship the ancient gods of Nordic tradition, chief among them is Shor, the Nordic version of Akatosh, who rules over Sovngarde, the hall of the honored dead. 

They have a long history of conflict, particularly with the Thalmor and the elves, whom they view with suspicion and distrust, partly due to the collapse of the ancient Nordic empire. The Nords also make up the bulk of the Stormcloaks, led by Ulfric Stormcloak, who fought against the Empire in the civil war to preserve their independence and traditional ways of life.
