*"Khajiit has wares, if you have the coin."*  

Khajiit are one of the beast races from the province of Elsweyr, known for their feline appearance and stealthy, agile nature. Their kind are often met with prejudice in other lands, particularly in Skyrim, where they are viewed with suspicion and disdain. Despite this, many Khajiit find work as thieves, assassins, merchants, or even smugglers, capitalizing on their natural talents.  

## Abilities and Professions  

---  

Khajiit are celebrated for their agility, stealth, and stealthy combat style, relying on their claws rather than traditional weapons. The Cathay breed, a more agile version of the Khajiit, is known for its proficiency in stealth and night vision. Some Khajiit specialize in trade, often seen traveling the land in caravans, while others become infamous for their involvement in smuggling Skooma, a drug popular in Skyrim.  

Khajiit are also known for their work as assassins and thieves, making use of their cunning and natural talents in dark environments. Despite the stigma they face, their skills often lead them to success in these professions.  

## Public Image and History  

---  

Khajiit are often subject to racial discrimination due to their appearance and the negative stereotypes surrounding them. They are frequently labeled as thieves, criminals, and drug dealers. This reputation leads to their exclusion from major cities, with many Khajiit caravan traders being forced to conduct business outside the city walls.  

Historically, Khajiit were oppressed in Morrowind, enslaved by the wealthier classes until slavery was outlawed. They also harbor a long-standing rivalry with the Argonians, exacerbating tensions in regions like Leyawiin and Bravil, where both races are present.  

In the wake of the disappearance of the moons Masser and Secunda, the Confederation of Elsweyr was absorbed into the Aldmeri Dominion, though this change did little to improve the Khajiit’s standing in the eyes of other races.

## Biology  

---  

Khajiit are a beast-race with feline features that vary greatly, with some resembling mountain cats like lynx and bobcats, while others resemble domestic cats or even larger predators like tigers. Their faces are often marked with faint spots or stripes, and they may wear accessories such as earrings, facial hair, and beads in their fur.

## Lunar Influence  

---  

The physical traits of the Khajiit are influenced by the lunar phases of Masser and Secunda. In Skyrim, the Khajiit seen are typically Cathay, a breed known for their agility, though other Khajiit can appear in various forms, ranging from small house cats to giant beasts, depending on the moon's phase at their birth.
