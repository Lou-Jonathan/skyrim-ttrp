*"Orcs, also known as Orsimer, are natives of Orsinium, a small mountain kingdom between Hammerfell and Skyrim. It has been sacked and rebuilt many times."*

The Orsimer, commonly known as Orcs, are a proud and warrior-focused race native to the Wrothgarian and Dragontail Mountains. They are often considered descendants of elves, referred to as "Pariah Folk," due to their tumultuous history and their connection to the god Trinimac, later replaced by Malacath. Orcs are renowned for their exceptional combat skills and masterful smithing.

## Strongholds
---
Orcs primarily reside in fortified strongholds scattered across Skyrim, particularly in the mountains. These strongholds are often closed off to outsiders, and Orcs typically require visitors to prove their worth before granting them entry. This is usually achieved by completing a significant task, such as slaying a foe or acquiring a valuable item.
