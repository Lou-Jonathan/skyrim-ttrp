## Biology

---

As a race, some Altmer strive to maintain the appearance of their ancestor race, the Aldmer, primarily through highly selective traditions surrounding marriage and reproduction. They are among the tallest of the humanoid races, taller than most humans and much taller than other mer. Their skin maintains a pale golden hue, not quite the pale white of northern human races like the Nords or Bretons, but far lighter than the Bosmer. They are slender, with prominently pointed ears and almond-shaped eyes that can be amber, green, or yellow. Altmer are among the most intelligent and magically-inclined races on Nirn, surpassing even the Bretons in magical aptitude. High Elves are well known for their noble countenance and are often perceived as arrogant or disdainful when addressing humans.

## Fourth Era History

---

### The Great War

Between the Oblivion Crisis and Dragon Crisis, the Mede Empire was attacked by the Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance of elves primarily composed of the Altmer and their Bosmer allies. The Empire saved itself only by negotiating the White-Gold Concordat, a treaty heavily favoring the Dominion despite great casualties on both sides. The ruling Altmer government, the **Thalmor**, are elven supremacists determined to end human dominance and the Empire's influence. They refer to the Great War as the "First War with the Empire."

### The White-Gold Concordat

The White-Gold Concordat allows the Thalmor to move freely throughout the Empire and to suppress the worship of the Man-God Talos. Resentment toward the Altmer—and the Empire for surrendering to them—runs rampant among Skyrim's proud Nords.

### Presence in Skyrim

Many Altmer encountered in Skyrim emigrated from the Summerset Isles to become alchemists, enchanters, and mages. Others joined the College of Winterhold due to their natural magical aptitude. Some Altmer loyal to the Empire fled the Isles to escape the Thalmor's rule, though their presence has sparked mixed reactions.  

Following the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, the Thalmor's presence in Skyrim grew considerably, primarily in the form of soldiers and Justiciars. These agents outlawed Talos worship, angering much of Skyrim's populace. The Thalmor's practice of taking citizens for interrogation with little evidence of Talos worship suggests their true goal may be sabotage and demoralization.

## Culture

### Origins and Identity

The Altmer are one of Tamriel's oldest races and early descendants of the Aldmer, themselves traced back to the divine et'Ada. Proud of their heritage, they strive to maintain their lineage. Their name translates from Aldmeri as "High Ones" or "Cultured Ones."  

The Altmer argue they are Tamriel's first true culture and its most civilized race, a claim even human scholars struggle to refute.

### Homeland

The Altmer primarily inhabit **Summerset Isle**, a large island off Tamriel's southwestern coast. According to legend, their Aldmeri ancestors fled to Summerset following the catastrophic sinking of Aldmeris. Although other elven groups spread across Tamriel, the Altmer remained on the Isles, maintaining their influence over Tamriel for centuries.  

Their culture significantly shaped the religion, language, and architecture of the Cyrodiilic Empire, and their influence persists to this day.
