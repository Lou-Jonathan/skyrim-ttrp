Tall Papa, a god worshipped by the indigenous people of the Summerset Isles, is one of the most mysterious and revered deities in Elven culture. Known for his embodiment of creation and eternity, Tall Papa is associated with the Anuic, or eternal, cycle of existence. He is often depicted as an enormous, towering figure, symbolic of his vast power and influence over all life and creation.

Tall Papa is believed to be the progenitor of the elves, and his followers regard him as the creator of their very essence. In this mythos, Tall Papa shaped the world, the heavens, and the stars, weaving together the Anuic pattern that governs all existence. This cosmic order brought about the foundation of all life, and his children, the elves, are seen as the living embodiments of this divine design.

In addition to his role as the divine creator, Tall Papa is a symbol of unity among the elven races. He is often called upon by leaders, especially in times of great need or uncertainty, for guidance and wisdom. The elves regard him as a father figure who watches over them and protects them from the chaos of the world.

Legend holds that Tall Papa is intimately connected to the forces of fate and destiny. It is said that he created the divine threads that bind all living beings, guiding them in their lives while also allowing for free will and choice within his greater design.

His worship is not widespread outside the elf community, though those who do follow him consider him the origin of all things and seek to live in harmony with the natural and divine order he created.
