Leki is the goddess of archery, the bow, and the skill of ranged combat. She is revered by hunters, warriors, and anyone who seeks to excel with a bow and arrow. In the lore of Tamriel, Leki is often depicted as a divine figure embodying the precision, focus, and skill needed for archery. She is most closely associated with the Khajiit, as her worship is prominent within their culture, especially among those who follow the path of the warrior or the hunter.

Leki's influence extends beyond just physical combat; she is seen as a symbol of discipline, patience, and mindfulness, qualities that are necessary to excel in archery and to live a balanced life. Those who follow Leki are said to receive her favor in the form of heightened dexterity and improved accuracy, especially with the use of a bow.

In Khajiiti belief, Leki is often invoked in times of need, particularly when the precision of a skilled archer is required for a hunt or in battle. She is also seen as a guardian of those who live by the bow, ensuring their success in their chosen endeavors.
