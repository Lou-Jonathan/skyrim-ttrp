Morwha is the goddess of love, fertility, compassion, and the nurturing aspects of life. She is often depicted as a benevolent figure who embodies the qualities of care and devotion, particularly toward family and the continuation of life. Morwha is one of the central deities in Khajiiti culture, where she is revered as the divine mother and protector of all life.

In Khajiiti myth, Morwha is the wife of Jone and Jode, the twin moons, and is deeply connected to the cycles of the moon, which represent the flow of time, the harvest, and the fertility of the land. As the goddess of fertility, she is also a patroness of the arts and creativity, and she is often invoked during weddings, childbirth, and times of harvest to ensure abundance and happiness.

Morwha is seen as a compassionate and gentle goddess, bringing comfort to those in need and providing solace during times of sorrow or loss. She is known to bless the union of lovers and to protect families, ensuring that they thrive and grow.
