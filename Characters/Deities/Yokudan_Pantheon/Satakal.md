Satakal is an ancient and powerful deity worshipped primarily by the Yokudan people, who associate him with the cyclical nature of existence. He is often depicted as a massive serpent, coiled in an eternal loop, symbolizing the endless cycle of life, death, and rebirth. In Yokudan cosmology, Satakal is said to be the embodiment of time itself, a force that continually devours its own tail in an endless cycle of creation and destruction.

According to Yokudan myth, Satakal once existed as a single, boundless being, but his desire to be all-encompassing led him to consume the entire universe, creating a closed loop of endless regeneration. This act of self-devouring caused all things to become part of an eternal cycle, where death is not an end, but a return to the beginning, and life is an ongoing rebirth.

Satakal is revered as a god of both life and death, embodying the notion that both are inseparable and part of the same endless cycle. His followers believe that through the endless repetition of life and death, true enlightenment and understanding of the universe can be achieved. They view him as a god who must be honored and feared, as he represents both the creation of new life and the inevitable destruction that follows.

His influence extends over the realms of time, fate, and eternity, and those who seek wisdom about the greater mysteries of the universe often turn to Satakal. In some interpretations, Satakal is also seen as a force of chaos, a god who transcends both order and disorder, perpetuating the eternal balance.
