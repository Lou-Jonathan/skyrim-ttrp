He is often depicted as a powerful warrior with a great sword, leading his people in both physical and spiritual struggles.

In Redguard mythology, The HoonDing is said to have been an immortal hero who walked among the living, imparting wisdom and strength to the people of Yokuda. The HoonDing taught them the art of war, battle tactics, and the code of honor that governs a true warrior’s life. His spirit is believed to be ever-present in times of war, guiding the Redguards in their military campaigns and personal conflicts.
