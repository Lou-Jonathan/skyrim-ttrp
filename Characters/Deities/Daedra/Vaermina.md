## **Lore**
---
Vaermina is the Daedric Prince of Dreams and Nightmares, a being who controls the realm of sleep and the experiences that come with it. She is often seen as a goddess of unconsciousness, influencing both the pleasant and the horrific visions that come in the dead of night. Her powers allow her to manipulate dreams, both for good and ill, feeding off of the dreams of mortals, drawing energy from their subconscious fears and desires.

Though Vaermina is known for her cruel side, often torturing mortals with nightmarish dreams, she is also revered by those who seek prophetic visions, as she can grant foresight through dreams. Vaerminaâ€™s followers believe that dreams hold the key to unlocking hidden truths about the self and the future, and they often seek her guidance in hopes of receiving divine revelations through their sleep.

Her realm, the Dreamstride, is a surreal landscape where the line between reality and illusion is blurred. Within her realm, the inhabitants are trapped in an eternal dream state, shifting between peaceful slumbers and terrifying nightmares. Mortals who experience Vaermina's touch may leave with new insight or be left broken by the horrors they encounter.
