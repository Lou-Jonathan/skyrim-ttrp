Mephala is one of the more enigmatic and secretive of the Daedric Princes, embodying the concepts of lies, deceit, and assassination. As a master of manipulation, she is often portrayed as the architect of schemes and intrigue, playing a central role in the subversion of mortal affairs. Mephala is also associated with sexual desire and forbidden passions, using these forces to manipulate and control those who fall under her sway.  

Her followers often see her as a patron of spies, assassins, and those who operate in the shadows. Her influence extends to those who wish to manipulate others, to engage in secretive and often deadly actions, or to enact revenge through subtle and clever means. Mephala's cults are known for their secretive nature and their intricate webs of lies, secrets, and manipulations. They often operate as hidden power structures within cities and kingdoms, pulling strings behind the scenes to achieve their goals.

Mephalaâ€™s involvement in mortal affairs is often marked by an undercurrent of violence, whether through assassination or the creation of discord and division. While she is not a figure who seeks direct conquest or dominance like some other Daedric Princes, her subtle influence can be just as deadly. She is often seen as a schemer who thrives on the hidden aspects of life, delighting in the lies and secrets that individuals and societies keep.

Her relationships with mortals are often transactional, offering power, knowledge, or influence to those willing to commit to her philosophy of deception and subtlety. As such, she is worshipped by assassins, spies, seducers, and those who seek to turn others to their will through manipulation.
