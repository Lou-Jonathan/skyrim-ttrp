Sanguine is the Daedric Prince of indulgence, excess, and hedonism. Known for his carefree attitude and love of life's pleasures, he embodies the pursuit of self-gratification and the fulfillment of earthly desires. Sanguine's followers are often those who seek pleasure, whether through drink, lust, or revelry, and his influence is strongest in situations where social boundaries are pushed and taboos are broken.

Unlike many other Daedric Princes, Sanguine does not care much for power or domination. Instead, he is content to revel in the pleasures of life, and he encourages his followers to do the same. His realm is filled with eternal feasting, drink, and celebration, where the pursuit of happiness and indulgence is paramount. Sanguine’s followers often celebrate life with wild parties, indulgent banquets, and carefree abandon, and they believe that the pursuit of joy and satisfaction is the highest calling.

Sanguine is also the Prince of Lust and excess, and while his realm is filled with decadent pleasures, it is not without consequence. He delights in pushing people to their limits, encouraging them to give in to their desires and live without restraint. However, his indulgence in excess can sometimes lead to ruin, as his followers often go too far in their pursuit of pleasure, suffering the consequences of overindulgence.

Sanguine’s influence is often seen in times of great celebration, festivals, and social gatherings. His followers are frequently found in the midst of orgies, drunken revelries, and wild nights of joy. Sanguine encourages people to enjoy the fleeting moments of life, celebrating the ephemeral nature of existence and the joy of the present moment.
