The Daedric Prince of Pestilence, Disease, and Order.

## **Lore**
---
Peryite is the Daedric Prince of Pestilence, Disease, and Order. He is often depicted as a twisted, insectoid creature, embodying both the chaotic forces of decay and the intricate patterns that govern it. While he is associated with disease and pestilence, Peryite's nature is not purely destructive; he also represents the concept of order within disorder, the cycle of life and death, and the role that decay plays in the greater balance of the world.

Peryite's followers, often known as his "Pestilent," are typically found in the most desolate and disease-ridden places of Tamriel. Despite his association with disease, Peryite's followers do not see him as a purely malevolent being. Instead, they view his influence as a necessary part of the natural world, one that purges the weak and brings about new growth. His followers often see themselves as part of a cleansing process, spreading his blessings (or curses) to those who are deemed unworthy or unclean.

Peryite's realm, the Farthermost Reaches, is a land of decaying, pestilent growth, a place where life and death exist in a delicate balance. This realm is home to Peryite's faithful, who undergo trials and purification in his name.
