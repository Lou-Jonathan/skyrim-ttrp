## **Lore**
---
Azurah, also known as Azurah or Azurah the Queen of the Night, is a powerful Daedric Prince of Oblivion and is revered by those who value both the light and the dark aspects of the world. She is the ruler of dusk and dawn, often depicted as a feline-like deity, embodying both the beauty and danger of the twilight hours. Azurah is known for her wisdom, grace, and the beauty she brings to the ever-changing sky.

As a Daedric Prince, Azurah is not tied to the mortal world in the way that the Aedra are. Instead, she influences the world of Oblivion, working behind the scenes to bring balance between light and dark. Her followers believe that she grants them wisdom and insight, allowing them to see the world through the eyes of both a predator and prey, light and shadow.

Azurah is also said to be the patron of those who are marginalized or misunderstood, often providing solace to outcasts, thieves, and those who live in the shadows. She is said to favor those who seek balance, embracing both the good and bad aspects of their personalities.

Her connection to the night sky and twilight hours also associates her with the concept of duality, as both the light and dark sides of existence play important roles in the cosmic balance.
