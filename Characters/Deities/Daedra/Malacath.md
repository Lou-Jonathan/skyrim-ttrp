# Malacath
---
The Daedric Prince of Curses, the Outcast, and the Patron of Orcs.

## **Lore**
---
Malacath, once known as Trinimac, was a god worshiped by the Orcs (Orsimer) in ancient times. However, after his physical form was consumed and twisted by the Daedric Prince Boethiah in an act of betrayal, Trinimac became Malacath—the god of curses, the outcasts, and the rejected. His transformation was both a punishment and a rebirth, marking him as a deity of endurance and defiance in the face of adversity.  

Malacath’s followers, especially the Orcs, revere him as a figure who embodies strength through adversity, self-reliance, and resistance against the forces of oppression. They view their existence as one of rejection from the greater societies of Tamriel, and as such, Malacath provides a sense of pride and purpose to his worshippers. To the Orcs, he is a symbol of resilience, the god that helps them endure hardship and triumph over their enemies.

While Malacath is not as widely worshipped as many of the other Daedric Princes, his influence is felt strongly in the strongholds of the Orcs in Skyrim and beyond. He demands loyalty to one's people and traditions, and his followers must be ready to fight for their place in the world, never yielding to those who would see them oppressed.
