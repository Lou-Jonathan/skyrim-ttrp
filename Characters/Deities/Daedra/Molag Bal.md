The Daedric Prince of Domination and Enslavement.

## **Lore**
---
Molag Bal is one of the most feared and reviled Daedric Princes, known for his obsession with the domination of mortals and the subjugation of their wills. He is commonly known as the "King of Rape," a title that reflects his unrelenting cruelty and desire to break the spirits of those he encounters. Molag Bal is often depicted as a monstrous, hulking figure with the features of both a vampire and a demon, reflecting his power over corruption and control.

Molag Bal's influence is seen in his twisted creations, such as the vampires, who are his loyal servants and an embodiment of his control over life and death. He seeks to torment the souls of mortals, turning them into mindless slaves or taking their essence for his own enjoyment. Those who fall under his sway often find themselves trapped in his domain, living in eternal suffering.

While Molag Bal's actions are centered on pain and suffering, he also represents the pursuit of ultimate power. Those who seek to become masters of their own destiny, no matter the cost, may be drawn to Molag Bal's philosophy. However, those who make pacts with him often find that his rewards come at the price of their humanity and freedom.
