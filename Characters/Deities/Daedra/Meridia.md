The Daedric Prince of Life and Energy.

## **Lore**
---
Meridia is the Daedric Prince of Life, Energy, and Infinite Light. She stands apart from many of her peers as she embodies all that is pure and radiant in the universe, a stark contrast to the often destructive or corrupting nature of the other Daedric Princes. Known for her obsession with the forces of life and vitality, Meridia seeks to eradicate death, decay, and darkness wherever they manifest.

Once a member of the Aedra, Meridia rejected her divine status and chose to follow her own path as a Daedric Prince. Unlike other Daedric Lords, she is not a ruler of suffering, but of life, light, and energy, seeking to bring vitality and force to all things living. Her energies are focused on cleansing the darkness, often at the expense of those who embrace necromancy or worship of the undead.

Meridiaâ€™s followers often include those who seek to heal the sick or who are focused on preserving the vitality of all living things. Many warriors and paladins revere her, seeing her as a symbol of light, strength, and resistance to the forces of the dark. She grants her followers the power to smite those who walk in the shadows, purging corruption and the dead with her radiant energy.
