# Namira

The Daedric Prince of Darkness, Hunger, and Obscurity.

## **Lore**
---
Namira is the Daedric Prince associated with darkness, obscurity, and the grotesque aspects of life. Known as the "Lady of Decay," she is the embodiment of all things that are vile, repulsive, and hidden from the light. Her dominion encompasses everything that is shunned, forgotten, or cast away, including the aspects of hunger and cannibalism. She thrives in places where others fear to tread, such as dark caves, abandoned tombs, and desolate ruins.

Namira's followers often embrace their dark natures, finding strength in their rejection of societal norms and the embracing of their inner monstrosity. Those who worship her are often drawn to the darkness of the world, finding solace in their rejection of light and the rules of civilization. Her followers may engage in forbidden practices like cannibalism, reveling in the act of consuming the flesh of others as a means of gaining power or appeasing their dark mistress.

Despite her association with decay and death, Namira represents the hidden strength found in darkness and the potential for growth that can arise from the most seemingly repulsive things. To her, everything has value, even if society deems it undesirable.
