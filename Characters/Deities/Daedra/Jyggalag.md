# Jyggalag
---
The Daedric Prince of Order, Logic, and Reason.

## **Lore**
---
Jyggalag is one of the most unique and enigmatic of the Daedric Princes, known as the Prince of Order. Unlike the chaotic and often destructive tendencies of his fellow Daedric Princes, Jyggalag is characterized by a relentless pursuit of perfect order and rationality. His realm, known as the Shining Land, is a domain of perfect symmetry and unyielding logic, where everything operates according to an impeccable, ordered structure.

Once, Jyggalag was a more prominent figure in the pantheon of the Daedric Princes. However, his obsession with order and his refusal to embrace the more chaotic aspects of existence made him a source of contention among the other Daedric Princes. In an act of spite, they cursed him, forcing him into a state of perpetual madness where he would transform into Sheogorath, the Prince of Madness, every year. This cycle continued for eons, with Jyggalag being trapped in his chaotic form until he was finally freed during the events of the Shivering Isles, where he was able to reclaim his true nature as the Prince of Order.

While Jyggalag is not as commonly worshipped as other Daedric Princes, he still holds a small following among those who value discipline, structure, and reason above all else. His followers are often scholars, mathematicians, and those who seek to impose order on the world, whether through law, knowledge, or pure intellectual prowess. They believe that the universe operates according to an ultimate set of rules and laws, and that understanding these principles can lead to transcendence.

## **Powers**

- **Order Manipulation:** Jyggalag can impose order on the chaotic, bending the flow of time, space, and reality itself to suit his rigid structure. His influence is often seen in the form of perfect symmetry, predictability, and control over the environment.
- **Logic and Reason:** Jyggalag possesses an unparalleled understanding of logic, mathematics, and the natural laws of the universe. He can apply this knowledge to manipulate the minds of mortals, enforcing strict adherence to reason and order.
- **Creation of Order:** In his realm, Jyggalag can manifest creations that are perfectly ordered and structured. These creations can range from complex machinery to perfect geometric forms, all serving the purpose of maintaining the principles of order and discipline.
- **Judgment:** Jyggalag can impose judgment on those who defy order, imposing rigid punishments or transforming them into manifestations of chaos and disorder. His judgment is absolute and without mercy, as he believes that those who embrace chaos must be disciplined.
- **Sheogorathâ€™s Curse:** While under the curse that binds him to Sheogorath, Jyggalag would transform annually into the Prince of Madness, losing his sense of order and embracing irrationality. After his release, this curse no longer binds him, but remnants of this duality remain within him.
