## **Lore**
---
Hermaeus Mora is the Daedric Prince who embodies the pursuit of knowledge, particularly forbidden, hidden, or obscure knowledge. He is often depicted as an ever-changing mass of tentacles, a manifestation of the unceasing desire for knowledge and the unknown. Mora is associated with both the dangers and the allure of acquiring knowledge that mortals are often too fragile to fully understand.

Hermaeus Mora is deeply interested in the accumulation of memories, secrets, and forgotten lore. He offers his followers the ability to access vast stores of arcane knowledge, which can include powerful spells, ancient secrets, or ways to manipulate reality itself. However, the price for such knowledge is often steep, and those who seek Hermaeus Mora's wisdom must be prepared to sacrifice their sanity or their very soul.

Those who make pacts with Hermaeus Mora are often scholars, mages, or those who seek to understand the deeper truths of the universe, no matter the cost. While his motives may seem impersonal, Hermaeus Mora has a tendency to favor those who strive for ultimate knowledge, no matter how twisted or dangerous that knowledge might be.
