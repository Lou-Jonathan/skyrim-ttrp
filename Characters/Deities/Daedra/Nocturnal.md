# Nocturnal
---
The Daedric Prince of Night, Darkness, and Luck.

## **Lore**
---
Nocturnal is the enigmatic Daedric Prince who rules over the night, darkness, and the fortunes of luck. She is often worshipped by thieves, shadowy figures, and those who live in the hidden recesses of society. Nocturnal embodies the mysteries of the night, as well as the fleeting nature of luck, which can bring both fortune and misfortune in equal measure. 

Her realm, the Evergloam, is a realm of perpetual twilight, where the line between day and night is indistinguishable. This shadowy place is the domain where she reigns supreme, watching over her followers and granting them her blessings—or curses—depending on her mood. While Nocturnal is often associated with stealth, secrecy, and the pursuit of one's personal desires, she is also known for her cold, distant nature. She is not a goddess of kindness, but rather of luck and opportunity, often rewarding those who understand how to operate in the shadows.

Nocturnal is also associated with the thieving guilds across Tamriel, particularly the Thieves Guild, where her followers perform their trade under her secretive blessing. In return, she demands obedience, secrecy, and the occasional sacrifice.
