# Hircine
---
The Daedric Prince of the Hunt, the Great Game, and the transformation into Werewolves.

## **Lore**
---
Hircine is the Daedric Prince associated with the Hunt, and all things related to wild animals, predators, and the thrill of the chase. His realm is one of vast forests, where great beasts roam freely and where mortal hunters are given the chance to prove their strength. Known as the "Father of the Hunt," Hircine is often depicted as a powerful, half-man, half-beast figure, surrounded by wild animals, particularly wolves and other predatory creatures.

Hircine's greatest obsession is the Hunt—an eternal competition where mortals, Daedra, and even gods may take part in a brutal chase for sport. He is known to bestow the curse of lycanthropy (werewolf transformation) upon mortals who capture his favor, granting them the ability to transform into a powerful wolf-beast at will. These cursed individuals are compelled to partake in Hircine’s hunts, where they are pitted against other mortals or creatures in a contest for survival.

While many view Hircine as a bringer of death and destruction, he does not view his hunts as acts of malice but as a way to test the strength and skill of his prey. He is an embodiment of the primal, instinctual forces of nature, where only the strong survive and the weak are culled from the herd.
