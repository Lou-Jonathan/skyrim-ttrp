Mehrunes Dagon is one of the most infamous and feared of the Daedric Princes, embodying destruction, chaos, and the desire for change. He is often depicted as a towering, monstrous figure with a body that exudes power and menace. His portfolio includes the forces of destruction, revolution, and the upheaval of established systems, and he seeks to bring down civilizations and break the status quo in favor of chaos and transformation.  

Mehrunes Dagon’s influence is particularly strong among those who crave change at any cost, whether through violence or upheaval. His followers often believe that destruction is a necessary precursor to renewal, as they view it as a means of clearing away the old to make room for the new. This philosophy has made Dagon a patron of both madmen and those who seek to overthrow established powers, such as tyrants and governments.

Dagon is infamous for his role in the Oblivion Crisis, where his forces attempted to invade Tamriel, causing great devastation. He opened a massive Oblivion Gate in the heart of the Imperial City, unleashing his daedric armies onto the world. Though his invasion was eventually thwarted, his desire for destruction has not waned, and he continues to seek ways to bring chaos and revolution to the mortal realm.  

In the eyes of his followers, Dagon’s path is one of freedom through destruction, believing that through the obliteration of the old world, a better, more liberated future can arise. However, his methods are often brutal, and his influence has left a trail of devastation in its wake.
