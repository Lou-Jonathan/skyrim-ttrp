# Clavicus Vile
---
The Daedric Prince of Bargains, Wishes, and Power.

## **Lore**
---
Clavicus Vile is a charming, manipulative Daedric Prince who embodies the concept of deals, bargains, and the granting of wishesâ€”often with a price. He is known for making pacts with mortals, offering them what they desire in exchange for their souls or a twisted fulfillment of their wishes. Clavicus is often portrayed as a dignified, regal figure, usually depicted with a dog named Barbas, who acts as his companion and messenger.

Unlike other Daedric Princes, Clavicus Vile often uses charm and persuasion rather than raw power to manipulate his followers. His cults are filled with those seeking to achieve their desires through bargaining and wish-making, and they are often lured into making deals that later turn out to be far more costly than they expected. His followers are typically individuals who believe they can outsmart Clavicus Vile and walk away from their bargains unharmed.

Despite his penchant for trickery, Clavicus Vile is not inherently evil. His deals are often considered fair, as long as the mortal involved does not attempt to cheat him or fail to uphold their end of the bargain. However, his bargains are typically built on a foundation of self-interest, and he delights in seeing others trapped by their own desires.
