Phynaster is the Aedric god of speed, the sun, and the passage of time. He is most often depicted as a youthful and vigorous figure, radiant with the warmth of the sun. Phynasterâ€™s domain encompasses the flow of time itself and the forces of swiftness, whether in physical movement or the intangible, unceasing progression of time. His influence can be seen in the motions of celestial bodies, the rapid growth of plants, and the relentless forward march of history.

In some cultures, Phynaster is closely associated with athletics, combat, and quick reflexes. His teachings emphasize the fleeting nature of life and the importance of seizing moments of opportunity. His followers believe that time is precious and should not be wasted, with many dedicating themselves to improving their speed, whether in physical pursuits, personal growth, or achieving greatness in their lives.

Phynaster is particularly revered by the Khajiit and their various lunar traditions, though he also has a widespread following among various groups in Tamriel who respect the virtues of vitality, movement, and time. The sun itself is believed to be Phynaster's physical manifestation, carrying his influence over the days and seasons.
