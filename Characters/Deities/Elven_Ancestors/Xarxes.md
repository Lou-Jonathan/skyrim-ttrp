## Lore

Xarxes is an ancient and enigmatic god associated with knowledge, wisdom, and the arcane arts. He was one of the Aedra who played a crucial role in the creation of the mortal world, contributing to the shaping of both the physical laws of nature and the mystical forces that govern the world of Tamriel. Revered as a divine scholar and patron of the magical arts, Xarxes is the god responsible for the creation of the magical structures and the architecture of time itself, influencing the flow of magic across the universe.

Xarxes is closely linked with the concept of wisdom and understanding, particularly through the study of the arcane and the pursuit of hidden knowledge. As a god, he is said to be a source of divine inspiration for mages, scholars, and those who seek to uncover the deeper mysteries of the world. His influence is vast, and his teachings are said to transcend both time and space, allowing those who study his ways to tap into extraordinary powers.

Despite his wisdom and the vast reach of his influence, Xarxes' nature is often depicted as aloof and enigmatic. He does not readily involve himself in the affairs of mortals but offers guidance through the pursuit of knowledge and magic. Some believe that Xarxes' greatest lesson is that knowledge, in its purest form, is neither good nor evilâ€”it simply *is*.
