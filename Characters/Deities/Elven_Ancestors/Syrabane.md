## Lore

---

Syrabane is an Aedric god associated with magic, particularly the study and mastery of the arcane arts. He is a deity of wisdom, intellect, and the pursuit of magical knowledge. Syrabane is revered as the patron of mages, scholars, and those who seek to unlock the secrets of the world through magical study. His teachings emphasize the importance of control, discipline, and respect for the vast forces that shape reality.

In ancient times, Syrabane was said to be one of the most influential gods in the pantheon, especially during the height of Elven empires, where his wisdom guided those who sought to understand the deeper, more esoteric aspects of magic. It is believed that Syrabane was responsible for the creation of many of the great magical artifacts that have shaped history.

Syrabane’s followers are often mages, researchers, and those who believe in the importance of using magic responsibly. He is particularly venerated by the Altmer (High Elves) and the Bretons, both of whom have a deep connection to magic. Syrabane's philosophy holds that true power lies in wisdom and self-restraint rather than in raw magical force.
