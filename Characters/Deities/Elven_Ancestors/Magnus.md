The God of Magic, the Sun, and the Architect of the Magicka.

## Lore

---

Magnus is one of the most important deities in the pantheon of the Aedra, and his connection to magic is absolute. As the god of magic and the sun, Magnus is the source of all magicka in the world. His followers revere him as the divine being responsible for granting mortals access to the arcane arts, and his power is integral to the fabric of reality itself.

Magnus is said to have been one of the original Aedra who helped in the creation of the mortal world, but upon realizing the cost of the world’s creation—particularly the way the mortal realm would be permeated with magic—he withdrew from the world, leaving behind his power in the form of the Sun. This is why the Sun is often depicted as a direct link to Magnus, radiating magic and life-force. His departure is also the reason why magic is such a potent, unpredictable force, as it is now untethered and only accessible through study and practice.

Magnus is viewed as a god of wisdom, foresight, and enlightenment. Many mages and scholars look to him for guidance, especially in the pursuit of mastering magic. His followers believe that the more they align with the forces of magic, the closer they come to understanding the true nature of the universe itself.
