The God of the Forests, the Green, and the Cycle of Life.

## Lore

---

Jephre is one of the more enigmatic gods of the Aedra, closely associated with nature, the forests, and the ever-turning wheel of life and death. He represents the natural world in all its aspects, from the blossoming of new life to the eventual decay that returns it to the earth. Jephre is worshipped primarily by those who live in close connection with nature, such as the Bosmer (Wood Elves), who hold him as their patron deity.

In Bosmeri tradition, Jephre is seen as the protector of the forest, keeping it balanced and healthy. His role is pivotal in ensuring that life flourishes and the ecosystem remains in harmony. He is sometimes called "The Green," and his influence is seen as necessary for the cycles of birth, growth, death, and rebirth that sustain life in the natural world. In this view, nothing is ever truly lost, but rather, everything is transformed and continues to serve the greater whole.

Jephre is also linked to the concept of renewal, as he is believed to ensure that the land remains fertile and capable of sustaining life. In Bosmer culture, his teachings help guide their hunting and gathering practices, ensuring they do not harm the land and only take what is necessary for survival.
