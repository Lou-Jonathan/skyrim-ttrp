## Lore

---

Auri-El is a prominent figure in the Elven pantheon, revered primarily by the Altmer as the god of the sun and light. He is often depicted as a powerful, radiant being who embodies the eternal cycle of life, creation, and the cosmic forces that govern the world. Auri-El's influence extends to all living things, with his sun symbolizing the source of warmth, life, and order.

Auri-El's lore is deeply intertwined with the creation of the world, and he is considered a direct counterpart to Akatosh, the God of Time. While Akatosh represents the flow of time and the preservation of existence, Auri-El represents the life-giving energy of the sun and the natural order. Many Altmer view him as the protector of their race, embodying their ideals of longevity, wisdom, and purity.

Auri-El is often associated with the Aldmeri Dominion and the ancient Elven civilization. His influence can also be seen in the practice of the Elven arts, and he is venerated in temples and shrines across Summerset Isle. His followers believe that through worship and adherence to the tenets of Auri-El, they may ascend to eternal life and gain wisdom through the sun's divine light.
