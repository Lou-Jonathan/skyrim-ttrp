Z'en, also known as Zen, is the god of trade, commerce, and wealth in the pantheon of the Aedra. He is often depicted as a figure of prosperity, symbolizing the balance between the material and spiritual worlds. Z'en is considered the divine patron of merchants, traders, and those who seek to make a living through commerce. His teachings emphasize the value of fair trade, the importance of wealth in society, and the idea that prosperity should be used for the greater good of all people.

Z'en’s role as a god is also tied to the idea of the exchange between different cultures and peoples. Through trade, knowledge is spread, goods are exchanged, and relationships between different lands are built. Z'en encourages the peaceful flow of resources and ideas, fostering a sense of interconnectedness and mutual benefit among Tamriel's diverse civilizations.

However, Z'en’s influence is not just economic. He is also revered as a god of balance, ensuring that wealth and power are distributed fairly and that trade remains just. His followers are often merchants, bankers, and other businesspeople who look to his wisdom for guidance on maintaining both prosperity and fairness in their dealings.
