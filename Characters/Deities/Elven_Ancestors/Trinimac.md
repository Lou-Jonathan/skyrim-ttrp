---

The Warrior God, Lord of the Orcs.

## Lore

---

Trinimac was a revered Aedric god and the patron deity of the Orcs (Orsimer). He was a warrior god known for his strength, honor, and noble ideals. Trinimac is said to have been one of the most powerful and respected of the Aedra, a deity who valued courage, fortitude, and the defense of his people. He was also closely associated with the virtues of self-discipline and integrity in battle.

However, Trinimac’s fate took a tragic turn. After a violent conflict with the Daedric Prince Boethiah, Trinimac was consumed and corrupted, turning into the dark and vengeful Malacath. Trinimac’s followers, the Orsimer, were deeply affected by his fall from grace. In their eyes, Trinimac was a god who had once represented the ideal of warriorhood, and his transformation into Malacath marked the beginning of the Orcs' difficult and tragic history.

Despite the transformation, the Orcs still venerate Trinimac, though in a different form, seeing Malacath as the god of outcasts and the protector of the Orcs' identity. Some Orcs may still pray to Trinimac, hoping for the god’s return and restoration to his former glory, while others focus their devotion solely on Malacath.
