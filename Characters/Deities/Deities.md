Tamriel, the continent where the events of *The Elder Scrolls* take place, is rich in diverse cultures, each with their own gods, spirits, and religious practices. From the Daedra to the Nine Divines, from the ancient Elven Ancestors to the Khajiiti and Yokudan pantheons, each belief system offers a unique view of the cosmos and divinity. Below is an introduction to some of the most prominent pantheons and deities in Tamriel.

## The Daedra

The Daedra are powerful and often capricious deities who reside in Oblivion, a plane of existence that lies parallel to Nirn. Unlike the Aedra, who helped create the world, the Daedra are often seen as alien beings with little regard for mortal concerns, operating under their own rules and desires.

While the Aedra are often seen as benevolent, the Daedra are known for their mischievous and sometimes malevolent nature. However, not all Daedra are evil; many possess their own unique agendas and ideals. Their influence can be both beneficial and harmful, and they are often worshipped by mortals seeking power or guidance in exchange for their service or worship.

Elven ancestor worship is a significant aspect of several elven cultures in Tamriel, particularly among the Altmer, Bosmer, and Dunmer. These races venerate their forebears, paying homage to the heroes and legendary figures who shaped their histories.

Ancestor worship can take various forms, from the veneration of revered kings and queens to the honoring of powerful warriors or wise sages. This worship is often tied to the belief that the souls of ancestors continue to influence the living, offering guidance and protection in exchange for proper respect and devotion.

The Khajiiti Pantheon is central to the religious practices of the Khajiit, the catfolk of Elsweyr. Their gods are deeply entwined with the land, the moon, and their culture, with a focus on the duality of their world. The Khajiiti pantheon includes both divine figures and lunar spirits, many of whom are believed to be manifestations of the moons Masser and Secunda.

Khajiiti worship centers around their connection to the moons and the natural world, and their gods often represent various aspects of their lives, from the pursuit of wealth to the art of thievery.

The Nine Divines form the central pantheon in Imperial religion and are revered by many across Tamriel. They are considered the chief gods of the Empire and the central tenets of their worship define much of the culture and governance of the region. Each god in the Nine Divines represents various virtues, such as justice, bravery, or wisdom.

The Yokudan Pantheon hails from the desert island of Yokuda, the ancestral homeland of the Redguards. Their gods are deeply tied to the themes of strength, war, and honor, with a significant focus on the protection of their people and their culture. The Yokudan gods are also tied to the concept of the "Divine Right" of leadership, and many of them symbolize the virtues of warlords and warriors.

Beyond the major pantheons of Tamriel, there are a number of other gods and spirits that are worshipped by smaller groups or are tied to particular cultures or regions. These deities often embody specific aspects of nature, war, and civilization.

Some of these deities are revered by smaller cults or societies, while others have remained obscure and mysterious, known only to a select few.
