The God of War, Storms, and the Protector of Man.

## Lore

Talos, also known as Tiber Septim, is one of the most significant figures in the history of Tamriel and is venerated as the god of war, storms, and the protector of humankind. A mortal who ascended to godhood, Talos is central to the Nordic pantheon, having once been a man who united the various human factions under the Empire and expanded its borders through military conquest.

As Tiber Septim, he played a pivotal role in the formation of the Third Empire, earning the title of Emperor and later ascending to divine status. His ability to lead and inspire was unparalleled, and his military genius and strength on the battlefield earned him the title of the "Dragonborn," further cementing his legacy as a god. His followers view him as a symbol of strength, leadership, and ambition, with many Nords specifically venerating him as the embodiment of the Nordic spirit.

Talos' apotheosis is one of the most contested events in Tamrielic history, with many arguing that his ascension to godhood is a direct challenge to the Aldmeri Dominion's views on divinity. His worship has been a subject of political and religious tension, particularly with the Thalmor, who have attempted to suppress Talos worship following the events of the Great War.

Talos is associated with war and storms, and his followers believe he grants them strength in battle, as well as protection from the elements. His shrines can be found across Tamriel, especially in Skyrim, where his cult is still widely practiced, despite the Empire's ban on his worship.
