His followers see him as the patron deity of all workers, merchants, and craftsmen, providing them with the strength to endure hard labor and the luck to succeed in their endeavors. Zenithar is often depicted as a muscular man with tools of trade in his hands, symbolizing his connection to honest work and industry.

In the history of Tamriel, Zenithar’s teachings emphasize the value of hard work and fairness in business. Many guilds, particularly those of merchants and craftsmen, worship him, seeking his blessing for prosperous ventures and the success of their craft. Zenithar’s influence extends to all forms of trade, from agriculture to high-end craftsmanship, and his worshippers often pray for good fortune in the marketplace or protection during long hours of work.
