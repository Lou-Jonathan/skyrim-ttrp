## Lore

Stendarr is one of the Nine Divines, revered as the god of justice, mercy, and protection. His role as the divine protector of the helpless is central to his worship. Stendarr is often depicted as a figure of righteousness, standing as the guardian of those who are unable to defend themselves, and a champion of laws and fairness.

He is associated with the qualities of mercy and protection, offering both compassion for those in need and judgment for those who commit evil. His followers are expected to uphold justice, serve the needy, and defend the helpless from tyranny and cruelty.

Stendarr’s influence is particularly strong among the Vigilants of Stendarr, an organization dedicated to eradicating the forces of Daedric influence, such as vampires, werewolves, and other evil creatures. The Vigilants travel across Tamriel, seeking to rid the world of such dark forces in the name of their god, believing that Stendarr’s mercy extends to those who repent but is harsh and unforgiving for those who choose evil.

Stendarr’s temples are often places of sanctuary for the persecuted, offering refuge to those who seek safety from unjust forces. His worshippers strive to balance mercy with judgment, offering forgiveness to those who are repentant while ensuring that justice prevails.
