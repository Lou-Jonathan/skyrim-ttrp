## Lore

The Magna-Ge, also known as the "Magna Ge," are a mysterious and ancient group of celestial beings believed to be the ancestors of the Aedra, or the divine gods of the pantheon. According to various mythologies and texts, the Magna-Ge existed before the creation of the mortal plane, prior to the birth of Nirn and the formation of the universe as it is known in The Elder Scrolls. They are considered to be the primordial forces of creation, the very essence from which the Aedra were eventually birthed.

The Magna-Ge are often described as "god-like" beings of immense power, far older and more elemental than the deities that arose after the beginning of time. It is said that they were present during the creation of the universe and were the ones who first shaped the physical and metaphysical aspects of the world. Their nature and exact roles remain somewhat ambiguous, and they are often linked to the creation of the Aedra and their subsequent actions in shaping the world of Nirn.

The Magna-Geâ€™s existence is tied to the myth of the Dawn Era, the time before time, when the world was still forming. In these early days, the Magna-Ge helped shape the laws of the universe, including the fundamental forces that govern existence. They are said to have assisted in the creation of the Aedra, and many consider them to be the "parents" or the forerunners of the divine entities known today. Over time, some of the Magna-Ge chose to remain outside the mortal realm, while others chose to incarnate as Aedra to shape the material world.

Some scholars argue that the Magna-Ge are not gods in the traditional sense but are rather powerful, unknowable entities whose influence extends far beyond the mortal plane. They are not often worshipped, but their legacy is seen in the creation of the divine pantheons and the origins of the Aedra. 

Interestingly, some ancient texts suggest that the Magna-Ge were ultimately a sacrifice, as part of the creation of Nirn and the mortal plane. Their essence, or divine energy, is said to have been dispersed throughout the cosmos, and many believe that the power of the Magna-Ge still permeates the world, even though they no longer directly intervene in the mortal realm.

The exact identity and nature of the Magna-Ge remain largely unknown, and much of their lore is shrouded in mystery. Their influence, however, is undeniably vast, as they were the progenitors of many of the gods that later became worshipped across Tamriel.
