## Lore

---

Mannimarco is one of the most infamous figures in the history of Tamriel, a powerful necromancer who ascended to godhood. His mortal origins trace back to the Altmer (High Elves) and his mastery of the forbidden arts of necromancy. He rose to prominence by serving as a royal court mage in the Summerset Isles, but his thirst for power led him to rebel against the established order, seeking to control the forces of life and death. He is the founder of the Order of the Black Worms, a cult of necromancers who revere him as a divine figure.

In his quest for immortality, Mannimarco made a pact with the Daedric Prince of Domination, Molag Bal. Through dark rituals, Mannimarco achieved a twisted form of ascension, becoming an immortal being, transcending his mortal form and becoming a god in the eyes of his followers. His reign over necromancy is absolute, and he is the patron deity of all who practice the forbidden arts of raising the dead and controlling spirits.

Mannimarco is often depicted as a tall, skeletal figure, crowned and robed in regal attire, symbolizing his mastery over death and the undead. He is an enigmatic and manipulative deity, seeking to further his control over the living and the dead alike. He holds a particular disdain for the gods of the Aedra, considering them weak for allowing life to end and for letting death be a natural process. Mannimarco, instead, seeks to overturn this natural cycle and impose eternal undeath on all.

His followers are often those who seek power over death, such as necromancers, liches, and other dark practitioners. They conduct forbidden rituals to reanimate the dead and attempt to bind souls to the will of Mannimarco. His influence extends throughout Tamriel, though his worship is often clandestine, given the highly illegal nature of necromancy in many parts of the world.
