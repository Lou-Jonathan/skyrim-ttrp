## Lore

The Hist are a race of sentient, ancient trees that are native to the swamps of Black Marsh, the homeland of the Argonians. These trees are deeply connected to the Argonian people, providing them with both spiritual guidance and, at times, physical transformation. The Hist are considered to be the creators and protectors of the Argonian race, and their influence is pivotal in shaping the history and culture of the Argonians.

According to Argonian belief, the Hist were the first beings to inhabit the marshes, with the power to shape life around them. They communicate with the Argonians through a form of telepathic connection, often using the sap of the trees to impart visions, dreams, and wisdom. The Hist provide the Argonians with guidance on matters both mundane and sacred, including advice on how to live in harmony with nature and the swamp environment. Their guidance is seen as sacred, with many Argonians believing that their lives are intimately bound to the will of the Hist.

The Hist trees also play a critical role in the Argonian’s spiritual rituals, such as the hatching of new Argonians. The Hist sap is consumed by the young during their hatching, imbuing them with knowledge, strength, and a spiritual bond to the trees. This ritual is central to the Argonian culture, and many Argonians believe that their spirits are tied to the Hist, with each Argonian's soul being shaped by the trees’ influence.

Despite the Hist’s reverence among the Argonians, their role in the broader world is not as widely understood. The Hist remain enigmatic to many, and their true nature is still a mystery to those outside of Black Marsh. Some outsiders believe the Hist to be gods, while others view them as an ancient species of tree-like creatures with a deep connection to the land. However, the Argonians themselves view the Hist as their divine ancestors, and the trees are regarded with the highest reverence.

The Hist trees are said to possess immense power, and it is believed that they can influence the passage of time and the physical transformation of their people. In fact, the Hist are sometimes thought to be capable of altering the Argonians’ physical forms, allowing them to adapt to different environments or situations. This power of transformation is most evident when the Argonians undergo their rite of passage, and the Hist are said to choose the form of the Argonian based on the needs of the tribe or the individual.

The Hist remain a mysterious and central aspect of Argonian culture, and their influence continues to shape the destiny of the Argonian people.
