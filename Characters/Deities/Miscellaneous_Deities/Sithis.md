## Lore

---

Sithis is the god of chaos, murder, and the Void, revered by the Dark Brotherhood and the followers of the assassins' guilds across Tamriel. He is the embodiment of darkness, destruction, and the endless unknown that lies beyond the stars. Unlike other deities who represent more tangible forces of nature or order, Sithis is the very essence of disorder and annihilation.

Sithis is said to exist beyond the mortal realm, beyond time and space, within the infinite Void. It is from this place that all life, death, and creation are birthed and eventually returned. As the god of assassination and secretive deeds, Sithis is often called upon by those who seek to end the lives of others, especially those who perform their acts from the shadows. His worship is most notably practiced by the Dark Brotherhood, a notorious organization of assassins who venerate him as the ultimate authority on death and murder.

Sithis is not a god of cruelty for crueltyâ€™s sake, but rather a force that seeks to restore balance through the annihilation of the unworthy or those who disrupt the natural flow of life. His followers believe that every death, every assassination, serves a purpose in maintaining the equilibrium of existence. Those who kill in his name are often guided by the belief that their actions are part of a greater cosmic design.

While Sithis is not widely worshiped outside of the Dark Brotherhood, his influence is far-reaching in the realms of those who deal with death and the unknown. In the Dark Brotherhood, his presence is felt in every ritual and whispered prayer, as members invoke his name before carrying out their assignments. His symbol is a black handprint, often stained in blood, representing the unseen touch of death that guides their work.

Despite his sinister nature, Sithis is not an evil god in the traditional sense. Rather, he represents the inevitability of death and the need for destruction to make way for creation. In this way, he plays an essential role in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.
