## Lore

St. Alessia, also known as the Slave Queen, was the first Empress of the Cyrodilic Empire and one of the most revered figures in Tamrielic history. She is considered the mortal leader who founded the first Empire of Cyrodiil, after liberating her people from the rule of the Elves and the Ayleids. Alessia’s role in the creation of the Empire is legendary, and she is credited with uniting the people of Tamriel under a single banner, giving birth to the Empire that would dominate much of the continent.

Alessia was born a slave to the Ayleids, the ancient elven civilization that ruled over Cyrodiil before the coming of the Empire. She was of humble origins, yet through her resilience and faith, she became the figurehead of a revolution that saw the downfall of the Ayleid overlords. It is said that Alessia was chosen by the gods, particularly Akatosh, who granted her the divine right to lead her people and overthrow the Ayleids. 

In her struggles against the Ayleids, Alessia was instrumental in rallying the slaves of Cyrodiil, including many Nibenean, Bretons, and other enslaved groups, to fight for their freedom. After defeating the Ayleids, she became the first Empress of the Cyrodiilic Empire and founded the Alessian Empire. This empire would go on to become a powerful political entity, shaping the future of Tamriel.

Alessia’s reign is also notable for the establishment of the Alessian Order, a religious movement that worshiped the gods of the Nine Divines, and for her role in instituting the first official recognition of the Eight Divines as the pantheon of the Empire. She was a pious ruler and devoted her life to serving the gods, particularly Akatosh, whom she believed had guided her in her triumphs.

Saint Alessia’s death marked the end of an era, but her legacy lived on in the Empire she founded. She is revered as a saint by the people of Cyrodiil and is honored in temples and shrines throughout the Empire. Her devotion to her people, her leadership, and her sacrifices in the name of freedom and justice have made her a symbol of strength and courage.

Her followers often invoke her name in times of strife or oppression, believing that St. Alessia's spirit continues to watch over them. She is especially revered by those who fight against tyranny, as her life exemplified the virtues of freedom, unity, and defiance against oppressive rule.
