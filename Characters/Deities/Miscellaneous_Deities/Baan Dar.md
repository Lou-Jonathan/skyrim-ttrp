Baan Dar is a deity of the Khajiit, revered as the god of thieves, bandits, and tricksters. Often depicted as a roguish figure with a mischievous smile, Baan Dar embodies the qualities of cunning, stealth, and freedom. He is a god who thrives in the shadows, encouraging his followers to live by their wits, taking what they need and evading capture. Baan Dar’s teachings are not about greed or cruelty but about survival, freedom, and the clever use of skill to achieve one’s goals.

Baan Dar’s origins are said to be tied to the moon Secunda, with some believing he was born from the moon’s shadow, an entity forged to protect the Khajiit in times of adversity. Known for his capricious nature, Baan Dar often provides guidance in the form of trickery, giving his followers the tools to outwit their enemies and navigate the dangers of life in Elsweyr.

Though a god of trickery and mischief, Baan Dar is also seen as a protector of the downtrodden, those who are oppressed by the law and society. He represents the outlaws and rebels who fight against injustice and fight for their own freedom, using subterfuge and cunning rather than brute strength. To his followers, Baan Dar is not a god of lawlessness, but a god who helps them fight against the unjust constraints of society.

Baan Dar’s influence can be seen in Khajiiti society through the prevalence of smuggling, thievery, and other clandestine activities. His followers are often found in the shadows of society, working behind the scenes to right perceived wrongs or simply to survive.
