The Old Ways refer to the ancient, primal faith practiced by the early peoples of Tamriel, particularly those who lived before the rise of modern religions and the establishment of the pantheons of the gods known today. The Old Ways are deeply rooted in the worship of nature, spirits, and the forces of the land, embodying a belief system that centers around the reverence for the earth, the seasons, and the elements of life. It is an animistic tradition, where everything in the world, from the mountains to the rivers, the trees to the wind, is seen as possessing a divine essence.

This faith was practiced by the early ancestors of the Nedes, the Orcs, the Nords, and various other indigenous groups in Tamriel, each of whom worshipped different manifestations of the divine forces of nature, often revered as spirits or gods that were intimately connected to the land and the natural world.

The Old Ways are characterized by a deep connection to the land, the stars, and the ancestors. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining balance with the natural world and honoring the spirits that reside within it. In contrast to the more structured pantheons of gods that came later, the Old Ways were more about direct interaction with the forces of nature, magic, and the elements, which were seen as sacred.

The religion of the Old Ways holds that all living things are interconnected, and that one's actions, whether in life or death, can have a lasting impact on the natural world. Some scholars suggest that the Old Ways may have influenced the development of later religious systems, including the worship of the Aedra and Daedra, though much of the knowledge of these traditions has been lost to history.

As civilization grew and formalized religions took root, the Old Ways slowly faded into obscurity, though remnants of the faith remain in some of Tamrielâ€™s more primitive cultures, such as the Bosmer, the Naga, and the tribes of the Nords and Orcs. The Old Ways also influence modern Neo-Druidic beliefs, where the worship of nature and ancestral spirits persists.

Despite being largely forgotten by the masses, there are still pockets of individuals and small groups who cling to the Old Ways. These people may worship the land, spirits, and forces of nature, performing rituals and offerings to honor the ancient powers. 

Some legends tell that the Old Ways still hold great power and that, if the ancient teachings are rediscovered, they may provide insight into forgotten knowledge of the world.
