Ebonarm is a lesser-known god in the pantheon of Tamriel, primarily worshiped by the Nibenese and certain groups of warriors across the continent. He is often depicted as a towering figure in dark armor, with a featureless face, embodying the very essence of warfare and battle. Ebonarm is not associated with any particular race or nation, but rather represents the brutal and chaotic nature of combat itself. 

Ebonarm’s origins are shrouded in mystery, with some legends claiming that he was born from the chaos of the Void itself, while others say he is a manifestation of the aggression inherent in all beings. Unlike other deities associated with war, Ebonarm does not favor the righteous or the just, but rather seeks to instill the desire for battle within the hearts of mortals, encouraging warriors to embrace violence and the harsh realities of conflict.

Though his worship is less widespread than that of other gods of war, Ebonarm’s followers are often those who live for combat and glory in battle. His influence is particularly strong among mercenaries, gladiators, and soldiers who fight for personal gain rather than any higher cause. His temples, often hidden away in remote areas, are sites of intense training and rituals meant to prepare warriors for battle. 

Ebonarm's teachings are not concerned with honor or duty but rather the art of warfare itself, including the philosophy of embracing conflict as an essential aspect of life. His followers believe that true strength is forged in the heat of battle and that only through continuous fighting can one achieve true mastery.
