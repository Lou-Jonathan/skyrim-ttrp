## Lore

Rajhin is the mischievous and elusive god of thieves, trickery, and stealth in the pantheon of the Khajiit. Known for his cunning and guile, Rajhin is a beloved deity among the Khajiit, particularly those who make their living through stealth, subterfuge, and deception. The deity’s name is synonymous with shadow and silence, and he is revered as a protector of the downtrodden, particularly those who use wit and agility to survive in a world that often overlooks them.

According to Khajiiti legends, Rajhin was once a mortal who ascended to godhood through his unparalleled skill in theft and trickery. His story is often told with humor and admiration, for Rajhin was not just a thief but a master of the art of misdirection. He would steal from the rich and powerful, using his talents to correct perceived injustices, though his methods were often seen as both morally ambiguous and highly entertaining.

Rajhin’s followers, known as the “Silent Ones,” believe that the god’s presence is most strongly felt in the shadows, where secrets are hidden and deals are made. In Khajiiti culture, it is said that Rajhin will reward those who are clever and swift enough to evade the law, but will punish those who are foolish or overly proud in their crimes. As such, he is a figure of both reverence and caution.

Rajhin’s influence is not limited to the Khajiit alone. His name is whispered among thieves' guilds, rogues, and anyone who walks the fine line between legality and crime. Many adventurers invoke his name when embarking on risky endeavors that require stealth, quick thinking, or a touch of good fortune.
