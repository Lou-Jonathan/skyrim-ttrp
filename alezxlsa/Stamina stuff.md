## **Stamina Calculation & Mechanics** 
---
You start with 10 Stamina at level 1, and you passively regenerate (Maximum Stamina - 5) / 3  each turn, rounded down.

Your Stamina Pool will increase for every level that one of the Stamina governing attributes increases above 10. Here is the list : 
- **Endurance**: 3 Stamina Points
- **Strength**: 2 Stamina Points
- **Speed**: 2 Stamina Points

Example : A Knight has 15 STR, 14 END and 12 SPE. The total Stamina Pool and Regeneration is :
END 14-10 = 4; 4 x 3 = 12
SPE 12-10 = 2; 2 x 2 = 4
STR 15-10 = 5; 5 x 2 = 10
Total Stamina Pool : 10(Initial Pool) + 12(END) + 4(SPE) + 10(STR) = 36
Stamina Regeneration per turn : 36 - 5 = 31; 31 / 3 = 10
