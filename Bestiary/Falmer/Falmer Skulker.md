### Actions
**Multiattack.** Falmer Skulker makes 2 attacks with its sword, or 2 attacks with its bow.

**Falmer Sword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

**Falmer Bow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.

**Frostbite.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d12) cold damage, and the target's speed is reduced by 5 feet for 1 round. Falmer Skulker can use its action on subsequent turns to automatically deal this damage and reduce the target's speed. This is a concentration spell that lasts up to 1 minute.
