### Actions
**Multiattack.** Falmer Warmonger makes 2 attacks with its bound sword, uses its Frostbite, and shoots an Ice Spike.

**Bound Sword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

**Frostbite.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d12 + 5) cold damage, and the target's speed is reduced by 15 feet for 1 round. Falmer Warmonger can use its spell attack on subsequent turns to automatically deal this damage and reduce the target's speed. This is a concentration spell that lasts up to 1 minute.

**Ice Spike.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 40ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d12 + 5) cold damage and 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage.
