### Actions
**Multiattack.** Falmer Nightprowler makes 2 spell attacks: one with an Ice Spike and the other with Frostbite.

**Falmer Sword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

**Frostbite.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) cold damage, and the target's speed is reduced by 5 feet for 1 round. Falmer Nightprowler can use its action on subsequent turns to automatically deal this damage and reduce the target's speed. This is a concentration spell that lasts up to 1 minute.

**Ice Spike.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 40ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d12 + 4) cold damage and 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage.
