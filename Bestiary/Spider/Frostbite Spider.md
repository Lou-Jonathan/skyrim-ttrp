### Actions
**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
