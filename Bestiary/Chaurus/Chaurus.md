### Charge  
If Chaurus moves at least 10 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with its bite attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the chaurus can make another attack with its bite against it as a bonus action.  
___

**Poison spit (recharge 5-6).** The chaurus exhales poisonous liquid in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
