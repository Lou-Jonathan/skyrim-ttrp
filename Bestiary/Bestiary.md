## Chaurus
---
**Chaurus** are worm-like insectoid creatures that typically live underground in caves and even in Dwemer ruins. They are deadly creatures, possessing the ability to spit out poisonous venom from their mouths, but they also use bite attacks during combat. Chaurus are almost always seen with Falmer in the underground cave networks and Dwemer ruins of Skyrim. The Chaurus appear to be used by the Falmer as pets and as fighters in combat, as well as torturers of people when their Falmer masters attack and capture bandits, traveling caravans and other people.

**Chaurus Reapers** can be found in deep underground caverns throughout Skyrim. They are much larger and stronger than the normal Chaurus, and love curling up in a shape similar to that of a Falmer's chest while sleeping. When in this position they will spring out and attack if touched or attacked.

**Chaurus hunter fledglings** are usually found inside of large pods, from which they will suddenly hatch if they feel an unknown presence nearby, or if they are attacked. They are found in many locations where adult Chaurus and Falmer live, and resemble giant wasps. Their usually fly around in erratic circles, stinging their targets, and spitting poison.

*"When a Chaurus reaches the end of its life, its body undergoes a dramatic transformation. After days of death-like stillness, the Chaurus Hunter bursts free from the husk of the Chaurus."* When a Chaurus reaches the end of its larval phase, it forms a chrysalis. Then, after a period of death-like stillness, the **Chaurus Hunter** rips out of its former shell. They are the strongest of their kind, and mostly go to wander only the deepest caverns and caves.

## Dragons
---
Dragons (Dovah, or Dov in plural) are a reptilian race from Akavir that were once widespread throughout Tamriel. Although seeming rather beast-like, they are profoundly intelligent, capable of speech, written language, and comprehension of other languages. Their spoken language can be used to cast powerful magic known as Thu'um or Dragon Shouts; dragons themselves are most adept in it, and it grows stroger as they do. They were virtually extinct until 4E 201, when they resurfaced in Skyrim with the return of Alduin.

In addition to their normal shouts, dragons can also use various other kinds of Thu'um, at the DM's discretion.

## Draugr
---
*"I don't know what sort of eternal wellspring they draw from, but it's clear that the draugr carry only the barest whisper of life in them, and it rekindles nightly while resting in its niche. I now believe that the grotesque forms that we see in the barrow were, in fact, buried fully as men and women, and only over the thousands of years that have passed withered into the wretched things we know. If we had visited a barrow directly after it's construction, we might not have even known any of its inhabitants were dead!"* -Amongst the draugr

Draugr are undead Nordic warriors of Skyrim. It is believed that draugr once served the Dragon Priests; some even know several Words of Power.

Draugr are among the most common foes in Skyrim's many crypts and catacombs. They retain the ability to wield weapons such as swords, axes, and bows, and higher ranked draugr can even use Dragon Shouts.

Most draugr use ancient Nordic weapons, although the high ranked variants can use ebony weapons. Some draugr only appear as corpses, usually containing a few pieces of gold. Draugr are weak to fire as well as silver weapons.

## Dwarven Automatons
---
Though Automatons are not entirely creatures, Dwarven Automatons range in size from smaller than a human to larger than a giant. They are golden colored, strong robotic creations made by the Dwemer. They are also extremely resistant to frost damage.

## Falmer
---
*"The Falmer are twisted, evil creatures that dwell in Skyrim's deepest reaches. They have but one desire - to destroy the surface world, and any who dwell above."*

The Falmer are the degenerate offspring of an endangered species of elves, Snow Elves, who dwell in the ancient Dwemer ruins hewn from Skyrim's expansive subterranean caverns. Although blind, their senses of hearing, smell, and touch are attuned far beyond those of most other races.

### History
---
The Falmer were not always the hideous, pale-skinned creatures that reside in ancient Dwemer ruins. They were once members of an even more ancient and powerful race known as the Snow Elves, beings of grace with wisdom beyond that of even the High and Wood Elves that now populate Tamriel's woodlands.

### Origins
---
A common misconception among the people of Tamriel is that the Snow Elves were tricked by the Dwemer into eating a mushroom native only to Blackreach, which then turned them into the repulsive creatures they are today; however, an unsullied Snow Elf by the name of Knight-Paladin Gelebor stated that with the little chance of survival, they willingly took to servitude and the poison that rendered them blind. Years of slavery and the blinding poison turned them into the sick and twisted race they are currently.

### Physiology
---
The Falmer's bodies are hideous, otherworldly corruptions of typical Mer physiology. Living in cramped, dark caves all their lives has rendered their backs hunched, their joints heavily scarred, and their skin deathly pale. Their eyes are tiny and useless, though their ears are larger and more sensitive than those of their surface-dwelling cousins. Their noses are nothing more than thin, skeletal slits on their faces, and their teeth are jagged and rotten. Although a typical Falmer may appear small and emaciated, they can be surprisingly quick on their feet and deliver quick, powerful blows with a sword.

## Frostbite Spider
---
Frostbite Spiders exist in several varieties and can be found throughout Skyrim's wilderness, as well as inside dungeons and mines (such as Redbelly Mine).

They will spit poisonous venom from afar during combat, which can be harvested and used on weapons after they are killed. Upon attacking, they will make a screeching or scuttling noise. They attack with their mandibles and legs when up close. Frostbite Spiders' health and strength depends on the size of the spider. Their lairs are often strewn with webs which they can use to descend upon their unwary prey from above.

Dungeons containing Frostbite Spiders often have webbing around their entrances. Inside, webs frequently contain the desiccated corpses of creatures and adventurers. While some can simply be walked through, others must be cut or burned away in order to proceed. While they are usually the sole inhabitants of their residences, Frostbite Spiders will occasionally share an abode with Vampires, Falmer, or other creatures, whom they are friendly with.

## Hagraven
---
*"This Hagraven was horrifying, almost human but more an abomination of woman and creature crow fused together, nothing more than a husk of humanity surrendered in exchange for possession of the powers of dark magic."* -Herbane

Hagravens are a mix of an old crone and a crow, and are exclusively female. They are often called witches, and many serve the Forsworn as Matriarchs
### History
---
Legend has it they were once witches but gave up their humanity to become hagravens. They despise nature, and hunt down spriggans to capture and sacrifice. The Forsworn revere them greatly, and in the book The Madmen of the Reach, it is noted that the hagravens were in the Reach since "the beginning."

### Appearance
---
Hagravens are hideous avian-like humanoids with scraggly grey hair, pale skin, hooked noses and solid black eyes. Their limbs are long and bony, and their hands and feet each have four digits ending in sharp talons. They dress in tattered black garments and have black raven feathers bound to their shins and forearms. All hagravens are female.

### Powers
---
For sacrificing their humanity, hagravens gain enhanced magical powers that trump most other witches and warlocks. In addition to an innate resistance to spells, hagravens can cast spells powerful warlocks can, as often as a sorcerer. They prefer to keep their distance, lobbing spells at any would-be attackers. In close quarters they will attack with their filthy claws. They can also cast healing spells on themselves when damaged or fleeing.

## Spriggan
---
*"I am Groot."*

The Spriggan is a creature that can be found across Skyrim. Spriggans can usually be found underground in caves, or in dense forests

### Behavior and appearance
---
Spriggans are beings which are made entirely of wood and magical energy; the source of which is their taproot. Spriggans are attracted to taproot, and Hagravens manipulate this weakness by hanging taproots from trees to attract spriggans. Hagravens then sacrifice them for their magical characteristics, and because of their hatred of nature.

### Combat
---
In combat, spriggans have the ability to use the Invisibility spell, heal themselves quickly when low on health, and attack their target with a swarm of bees which can poison it.

Their most notable ability is their ability to enthrall the nearby wildlife - including animals not normally hostile like deer, goats and foxes - to come to their aid; enthralled animals bear a green aura and the effect can be overridden with the Animal Allegiance or Kyne's Peace shouts.

## Trolls
---
*"Trolls can be found in any region throughout Skyrim, both deep underground or wandering the wilds."*

Trolls are large, hairy, ape-like creatures with sharp fangs, claws and long, powerful arms. These creatures have three beady black eyes, their skulls being easily recognized by their three eye sockets. Commonly found in forests, such as the Rift, trolls also inhabit caves, ruins, and mountains. While they are not very intelligent, Trolls compensate with tough physical prowess and the ability to regenerate health.

## Wisp
---
Wisps are small, glowing phantasms. They typically appear with Wispmothers, and drain their victims' life energy with their special attack, Wisp's Kiss. Destroying them causes damage to the Wispmother.

### Behaviour
---
Wisps often float around other wisps if they are in the same area, but will attack if provoked. However, it is possible to walk among the wisps without them attacking.

## Wispmother
---
Wispmothers are creatures found in the frozen, mountainous regions of Skyrim. Wisps can be spotted floating in the wild, and remain neutral. If the wisp is approached, it moves away and eventually leads to a wispmother.

### Combat
---
During combat, wispmothers summon three to four smaller wisps or shades to attack while she casts a volley of frost spells. The wispmother stays on the move to avoid magical attacks. The smaller wisps follow whomever the wispmother is attacking, regardless of distance, and drain health.
