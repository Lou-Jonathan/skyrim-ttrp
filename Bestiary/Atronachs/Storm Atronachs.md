### Description
---
Similar to a Flame Atronach, Storm Atronachs move about by hovering above the ground. They can travel over water, and are slightly faster than Frost Atronachs. They are perhaps the least humanoid of Atronachs, appearing as a shattered statue with a cracked, frowning face and chunks of rock swirling about its body, loosely connected by a matrix of electric arcs and dark purple storm clouds.
They are often summoned by powerful dragon priests to assist them in combat.
