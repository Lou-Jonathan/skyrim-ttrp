**Shield.** When carrying a sword and a shield, Draugr Scourge gets an additional +2 to its AC, but cannot make spell attacks.  

**Multiattack.** Draugr Scourge makes 2 Ancient Nord Sword attacks and 1 spell attack, or it can shout.  

### Actions  

**Ancient Nord Sword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d8 + 7) slashing damage.  

**Frostbite.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d12) cold damage, and the target's speed is reduced by 15ft. for 1 round. Draugr Scourge can automatically deal this damage by using its spell attack and reduce the target's speed. This is a concentration spell that lasts up to 1 minute.  

**Ice Spike.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 40ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d12) cold damage and 9 (2d8) piercing damage.  

**Unrelenting Force: Fus-Ro-Dah.** All creatures in a 30-foot cone in front of Draugr Scourge must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be flung to the end of its reach, landing prone upon landing. If the creature is Huge or larger, or a dragon, it is not flung, but loses its balance and falls prone nevertheless on a failed save.  

### Description
---
The **Draugr Scourge** is a powerful type of undead that typically serves as a guardian or leader in draugr-filled crypts and dungeons. They're possibly the most perceptive kind of draugr, and sneaking past them is rarely possible.
