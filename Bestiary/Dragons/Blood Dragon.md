**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. The target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Yol-Toor-Shul (Fire Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Fo-Krah-Diin (Frost Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If it fails the saving throw, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Description
---
Blood Dragons look radically different from brown dragons. They are green in appearance, and are slightly larger in mass, with a more intimidating body design. On their back they have a small sail, and their tails, instead of the regular spade shape, have a broad leaf-like design much like that of the sail on their spine, ending in a sharp tip.

The Blood Dragons also have a unique skull formation, being more rounded before pointing off at the jaw. They have a frill on the back of their skulls, and their eyes—unlike those of other dragons—have pupils which run horizontally rather than vertically, producing a more unsettling appearance.

Blood dragons follow their prey, even circling around cities, waiting for their targets to emerge while hiding. The only way to escape a blood dragon, is to lead it to a more desirable prey, like a small, defenseless village or camp and flee as it attacks.

For a frost variant, simply swap fire immunity and cold resistance, and have the dragon use frost breath as its main weapon.
