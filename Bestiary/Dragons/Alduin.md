___
**Soul of the Dov.** Alduin has advantage on all saving throws.

**Adaptation.** Alduin can move across and climb any surface without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain doesn't cost it extra movement.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If Alduin fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Alduin can use its Frightful Presence. He then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +19 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The creatures hit must then make a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Alduin's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Alduin's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Yol-Toor-Shul (Fire Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** Alduin exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 117 (26d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Fo-Krah-Diin (Frost Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** Alduin exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 99 (22d8) cold damage and have its speed reduced by 15 feet for 1 minute. A successful save halves the damage and negates the speed reduction. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the speed reduction on a success.

**Fus-Ro-Dah (Unrelenting Force) (Recharge 5-6).** Alduin lets out a roar empowered by his own soul, shooting each creature in a 90-foot cone. Each creature caught in the shout must make a DC 24 Strength saving throw or take 90 (20d8) points of force damage and be thrown away 90 feet in the direction of the shout, taking an additional 31 (9d6) points of bludgeoning damage upon landing prone. A successful saving throw halves the damage and stops the target from being flung away.

**Meteor Storm (2/day).** Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points Alduin can see within 1 mile. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point chosen must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.

### Legendary Actions
Alduin can take 5 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** Alduin makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** Alduin makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Alduin beats its wings. Each creature within 20 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Alduin can then fly up to half its flying speed.

### Description
---
*"You do not even know our tongue, do you? Such arrogance, to dare take for yourself the name of Dovah!"*
―Alduin to the Last Dragonborn

___
Alduin, the World Eater, also considered an alternative name of Akatosh by some of Tamriel, is the most powerful dragon to have ever existed. He is considered the "wellspring" of the Nordic pantheon, as well as the harbinger of the apocalypse. He is also described as the "creator of dragon civilization" in one particular text ("Shalidor's insight").

#### History
Nordic myth asserts that Alduin destroyed the last world to begin this one. As a result, he is both creator and destroyer, as well as predating the creation of Nirn itself. There are legends of his battles with Shor during this time.

During the Merethic Era, the people of Atmora and Skyrim worshiped dragons, possibly at the urging of Alduin.
He also conspired with Orkey to reduce all the Nords to children, until he was again defeated by Shor. Some consider that Alduin's rule during this period was foresaking his proper role as the World-Eater. 

Alduin served as a leader of the dragons, and he ruled with an iron fist. The humans either worshiped him or were enslaved. The humans worshiped him and the dragons in the Dragon Cult. High ranking members of this cult would be known as a Dragon Priest. Alduin's lieutenant at the time was Paarthurnax, but secretly Paarthurnax was betraying him. Paarthurnax was teaching the voice to the humans so that they could rebel against their dragon overlords. The ensuing war would be known as the Dragon War.

He was ultimately sent forward in time through the actions of three Nordic heroes, who created a new Shout to subdue him, and used an Elder Scroll to send Alduin forward in time.

___
*"And the Scrolls have foretold, of black wings in the cold, That when brothers wage war come unfurled! Alduin, Bane of Kings, ancient shadow unbound, With a hunger to swallow the world!"*
―Song of the Dragonborn
