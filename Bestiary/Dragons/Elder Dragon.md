### Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire or cold damage (dragon's choice).

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. The creatures hit must then make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Fo-Krah-Diin (Frost Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 54 (12d8) cold damage and have its speed reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. A successful save halves the damage and negates the speed reduction.

**Yol-Toor-Shul (Fire Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

### Description
---
Not these dragons are they larger, and obviously more intimidating, than their brown and green cousins, but they feature a more noticeable bronze colored body, with spots of black dotting the skin. Instead of a row of spines, or a sail, these dragons have a mere row of bony bumps dotting their spine, however, they essentially trade that for a meaner, more aggressive looking facial structure. They have two massive, curved horns on their heads, with a more angular, pointy face. Lastly, these dragons also possess the regular spaded tail that the Brown and Frost dragons also have.


Elder dragons do not have a favored elemental shout, instead using either a Fire Breath shout, or a Frost Breath shout. They are far more powerful than previous dragon variants in terms of attacks, both ranged and physical, meaning engaging these dragons is quite a battle.
