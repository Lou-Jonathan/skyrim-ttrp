**Ice Walk.** The Frost Dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite or tail and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) cold damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Tail Sweep.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10ft., up to 3 targets within reach. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The creatures hit must then make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Fo-Krah-Diin (Frost Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 63 (14d8) cold damage and have its speed reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. A successful save halves the damage and negates the speed reduction. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the speed reduction on a success.

### Description
---
Frost Dragons are powerful creatures that control the chill of winter itself. With their formidable icy breath and ability to glide through snow and ice with ease, they dominate frozen environments. Their majestic appearance and intimidating presence make them formidable adversaries in battle.
