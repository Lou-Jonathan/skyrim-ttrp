___
**Soul of the Dov.** The ancient dragon has advantage on all saving throws against magic.

**Adaptation.** The dragon can move across and climb any surface without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain doesn't cost it extra movement.

**Legendary Resistance (3/day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 20ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The creatures hit must then make a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Yol-Toor-Shul (Fire Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Fo-Krah-Diin (Frost Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or take 54 (12d8) cold damage and have its speed reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. A successful save halves the damage and negates the speed reduction. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the speed reduction on a success.

### Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.

### Description
---
In terms of overall appearance, these dragons possess a similar look to Elder Dragons, except they possess a color change, being more tan and pink in color, rather than bronze and yellow. The black splotches still remain on the dragon, and are noticeable on the head crests, wings, and tail.
These dragons have a more spiny back, with a seeming triple row of small, stubby spikes, lining down the spine, to the tail. In terms of size, these dragons are the largest, barring Legendary variants, and they, like others, possess a spaded tail.

They are the most powerful breed of dragons, and a force to be truly reckoned with. Luckily, they are rare, and only a few were brought back by Alduin. They are also scarily intelligent, and each of them is working on their own malevolent plans for Skyrim.
