### Actions
---
- **Multiattack.** Dragon makes 2 attacks: one with its bite, and one with its tail.

- **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

- **Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

- **Yol-Toor-Shul (Fire Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- **Fo-Krah-Diin (Frost Breath) (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails its save, its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Description
---
Brown dragons are a smaller breed of dragon with a large wingspan, spines lining their backbone, and a spaded tip at the end of their tail. They are the weakest and most common type of dragon, though still very powerful.

In combat, brown dragons typically use Fire Breath as their primary attack, but may occasionally use Frost Breath if they encounter targets that are resistant or immune to fire.

**Frost Variant:** For a frost variant, swap fire immunity and cold resistance, and have the dragon use Frost Breath as its main attack.
