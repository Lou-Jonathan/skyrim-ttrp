### Description
---
Dwarven spheres can be found in all Dwemer ruins. When not engaged in combat, they are found folded up into a large metal ball shape roughly a meter in diameter, rolling around via a pair of diagonal wheels on either side. When they sense an intruder nearby, Dwarven Spheres will open up and unfold their body to full height, attacking with whatever weapons are mounted on their forearms. They can also appear out of massive pipes in the walls, popping out when a nearby trap is triggered, or simply if an intruder gets too close.

**Combat.** Though they appear lanky, Dwarven Spheres are fast and tough. They are often armed with a sword blade mounted on one forearm and a crossbow on the other, allowing them to attack both up-close and from afar.
