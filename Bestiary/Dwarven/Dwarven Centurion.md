___
**Magic Resistance.** Dwarven centurion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and takes only half damage from magical sources.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Centurion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions
**Multiattack.** Dwarven centurion makes 3 attacks: 2 with its warhammer and 1 with its battleaxe.

**Dwarven Warhammer.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The creature must then make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Dwarven Battleaxe.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) slashing damage. The creature must then make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The Dwarven Centurion exhales scalding steam in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 (22d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.

### Description
---
Dwarven Centurions are very large mechanical guardians in Dwemer ruins. Their giant bodies, undoubtedly designed for combat, are constructed of solid Dwemer blocks and armored with thick dwarven plates. Their arms are equipped with a Dwarven Warhammer and a Dwarven Battleaxe. Their enormous body makes them move slowly, but they can take lots of damage and use very powerful attacks.

Of all the Animunculi left behind by the ancient Dwemer, the Dwarven Centurions are the most elaborately constructed, well-armed, defensive, and arguably the most dangerous.
