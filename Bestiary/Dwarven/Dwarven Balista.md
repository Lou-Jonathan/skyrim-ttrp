**Magic Resistance.** Dwarven balista has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Powerful Bolts.** Dwarven balistas shoot powerful metal spears that can pierce the most powerful armor. When an armored enemy is struck with a bolt, it receives a -1 penalty to Armor Class until the armor is repaired. If this reduction reduces the Armor Class received from the armor to 0, the armor is destroyed. If an unarmored enemy is hit with a bolt, double the damage from it.

### Actions
**Balista Bolt.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 120/320ft., one target. *Hit:* 49 (8d10 + 5) piercing damage.

### Description
---
*"One of the most dangerous Steam Animunculi is the Dwarven Ballista, which fires a 
bolt that can penetrate even the thickest armor."*

___

Created by the Dwemer long ago, the Dwarven Ballistas served as guardians and 
warriors. Much like Dwarven Spheres, Dwarven Ballistas maintain a constant vigil
over the ruins their masters once called home.
