### **Chaos Incarnate**

The **Chaos Incarnate** property embodies the raw, unfiltered essence of madness and unpredictability. When activated, the Wabbajack taps into the _Screaming Vortex of Unreality_, where the laws of physics are optional and logic is a distant memory. Each use of the Wabbajack rolls on the _Table of Infinite Possibilities_, a metaphysical list of outcomes that includes, but is not limited to:

- Turning the target into a sweetroll, a chicken, or a sentient wheel of cheese.
- Summoning a herd of flaming goats or a swarm of angry butterflies.
- Dealing random elemental damage (fire, frost, shock, or inexplicably, _cheese damage_).
- Healing the target, but only if they agree to sing a polka song.
- Creating a temporary portal to the _Shivering Isles_, because why not?

The wielder has no control over the outcome, and neither does the Wabbajack—it simply _does what it wants_. Some say the staff laughs maniacally after each use, though this could just be the wielder’s imagination (or the onset of madness). One thing is certain: Chaos Incarnate ensures that no two uses of the Wabbajack are ever the same, and sanity is always the first casualty.
