# **Scout**
---
Scouts are skilled pathfinders, trained to navigate Tamrielâ€™s vast and untamed wilderness. Whether serving as outriders for military forces, trackers for bounty hunters, or lone wanderers in pursuit of adventure, Scouts excel at survival and adaptability. Their keen senses and endurance allow them to thrive in hostile environments, making them invaluable in both exploration and reconnaissance. With a bow in hand and light armor for protection, they can strike swiftly before vanishing into the wilds.
