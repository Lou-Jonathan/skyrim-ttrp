# **Assassin**
---
Assassins are deadly killers who strike from the shadows, leaving no trace of their presence. Masters of stealth, archery, and close-quarters combat, they eliminate their targets with ruthless efficiency. Whether working for a shadowy guild or pursuing their own agenda, Assassins are feared for their precision, cunning, and ability to vanish without a trace. They thrive in the darkness, where their skills make them both predator and ghost.
