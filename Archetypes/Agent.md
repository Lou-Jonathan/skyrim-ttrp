# **Archer**
---
Archers are masters of ranged combat, striking from the shadows with deadly precision. They are skilled hunters, trackers, and scouts, often serving as the eyes and ears of their allies. Archers rely on their agility and keen senses to outmaneuver enemies, using the environment to their advantage. Whether defending a forest homeland or patrolling distant frontiers, Archers are unmatched in their ability to deliver swift, silent justice from afar.
