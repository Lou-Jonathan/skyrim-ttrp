# **Witchhunter**
---
Witchhunters are mystical trackers, specializing in hunting down rogue mages, daedra, and supernatural threats. They blend alchemy, archery, and stealth with a deep understanding of magic, making them formidable foes to those who dabble in dark arts. Unlike traditional warriors, Witchhunters favor agility and precision, striking with enchanted arrows and disruptive spells before their enemies can react. Their mastery of Mysticism and Conjuration allows them to detect and counter dark forces, ensuring that no sorcerer or abomination can escape their pursuit.
