# **Knight**
---
Knights are paragons of honor and duty, sworn to protect the weak and uphold justice. Clad in gleaming heavy armor and wielding their blades with precision, they are a bastion of strength on the battlefield. Knights combine their combat prowess with restoration magic to heal their wounds and inspire their allies. Whether defending a kingdom, leading a charge, or standing as a symbol of hope, Knights embody the ideals of courage, loyalty, and unwavering resolve.
