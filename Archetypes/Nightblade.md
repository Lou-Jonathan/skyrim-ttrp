# **Nightblade**
---
Nightblades are masters of shadow and subterfuge, blending stealth with dark magic to strike from the darkness. They use illusion spells to confuse and mislead their enemies, while destruction magic ensures their targets never see them coming. Nightblades are deadly assassins and saboteurs, thriving in the chaos they create. Whether working for a shadowy guild or pursuing their own agenda, they are feared for their ability to vanish without a trace, leaving only destruction in their wake.
