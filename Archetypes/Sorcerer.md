# **Sorcerer**
---
Sorcerers are powerful mages who focus on destructive and controlling magic. Clad in heavy armor, they are as durable as they are deadly, summoning daedra and wielding elemental forces to dominate their enemies. Unlike more fragile spellcasters, Sorcerers embrace endurance and raw magical might, channeling immense reserves of magicka to sustain their arcane onslaught. Many seek forbidden knowledge, delving into the depths of Oblivion for power beyond mortal comprehension.
