# **Acrobat**
---
Acrobats are the embodiment of grace and agility, moving through the world with unparalleled finesse. Whether scaling towering walls, leaping across rooftops, or dodging attacks with ease, Acrobats thrive in environments where others falter. Often found in bustling cities or treacherous wilderness, they are masters of evasion and quick thinking, using their physical prowess to outwit and outmaneuver their foes. Acrobats are not just fightersâ€”they are performers, thieves, and adventurers, always one step ahead of danger.
