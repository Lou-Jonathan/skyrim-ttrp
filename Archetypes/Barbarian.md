# **Barbarian**
---
Barbarians are fierce warriors hailing from rugged tribal lands, where survival depends on strength and ferocity. They wield massive weapons with unmatched power, charging into battle with a roar that strikes fear into their enemies. Clad in heavy armor or bare-chested to display their scars, Barbarians thrive in the chaos of combat, relying on raw endurance and unyielding will to crush their foes. Whether defending their homeland or seeking glory in battle, Barbarians are unstoppable forces of nature.
