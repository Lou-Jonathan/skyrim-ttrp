# **Healer**
---
Healers are compassionate souls dedicated to mending wounds, curing ailments, and bringing hope to the suffering. Masters of restoration magic and alchemy, they are often found in temples, battlefield infirmaries, or wandering the land to aid those in need. Healers use their wisdom and empathy to soothe both physical and emotional pain, earning the trust and gratitude of all they help. Though they prefer peace, Healers are not defenselessâ€”they can call upon their knowledge of alteration and illusion to protect themselves and others when necessary.
