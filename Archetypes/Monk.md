# **Monk**
---
Monks are disciplined warriors who rely on their bodies and minds rather than weapons or armor. Through rigorous training, they master hand-to-hand combat, acrobatics, and restoration magic, embodying the principles of balance and inner strength. Monks are often found in secluded monasteries, where they meditate and hone their skills, but they are equally capable of navigating the chaos of the outside world. Their calm demeanor and unwavering focus make them formidable opponents and wise allies.
