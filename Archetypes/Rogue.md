---
Rogues are masters of deception and stealth, using their charm and cunning to achieve their goals. Whether picking locks, disarming traps, or striking from the shadows, they excel at avoiding direct confrontation. Rogues are skilled in both combat and manipulation, making them versatile and unpredictable. They thrive in the shadows, where their quick reflexes and sharp wits allow them to outmaneuver even the most vigilant foes.
