# **Thief**
---
Thieves are masters of stealth and subterfuge, thriving in the shadows. They excel in breaking into secured places, pickpocketing, and avoiding detection. Their agility and cunning make them the ultimate opportunists in the criminal underworld. Whether working alone or as part of a guild, they rely on quick wits, nimble fingers, and an uncanny ability to disappear when the law comes calling. Some see them as mere criminals, but to a skilled Thief, every locked door is an opportunity and every mark is a challenge.
