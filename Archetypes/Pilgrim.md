# **Pilgrim**
---
Pilgrims are devout travelers, often on a spiritual journey to seek enlightenment or fulfill a sacred duty. They rely on restoration magic and alchemy to heal and protect themselves and others, while their mastery of speechcraft allows them to inspire and persuade. Pilgrims embody the virtues of patience, resilience, and compassion, often aiding those they meet along their path. Though they prefer peaceful resolutions, their resourcefulness and endurance make them capable of defending themselves when necessary.
