# **Spellsword**
---
Spellswords are versatile warriors who combine martial prowess with magical aptitude. They wield swords in one hand and spells in the other, blending combat and sorcery to adapt to any situation on the battlefield. Unlike battlemages, who focus on overwhelming magical offense, Spellswords prioritize balance, using their arcane talents to reinforce their swordplay. Whether augmenting their defenses with Alteration, healing wounds mid-combat, or scorching foes with Destruction magic, they are formidable opponents who thrive in both melee and magic.
