### **Block Mechanic**

- **Stamina Cost**: Blocking an attack consumes **5 stamina**. If your stamina drops to 0, you can no longer block effectively, reducing your AC bonus to 0 until you recover stamina.
- **Stagger Chance**: If you block a heavy attack (e.g., a power attack), you must succeed on a **Strength saving throw** (DC = 10 + attacker’s Strength modifier) or be **staggered**, losing your reaction and taking half damage.
- **Perfect Block**: If you block an attack with **full stamina**, you can attempt a **Perfect Block**. Roll a **Dexterity or Strength check** (your choice) against the attacker’s attack roll. If you succeed, you take **no damage** and the attacker is **staggered** for 1 round.

- **Stamina Management**: If your stamina drops to 0, you can no longer perform power attacks.
