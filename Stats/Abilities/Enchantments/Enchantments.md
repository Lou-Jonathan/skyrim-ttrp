Finishing the infusion of his longsword, the warlock reveals a small smile. "I think I'll call you...the Blooddrinker," he said. "Because that is why I will use you for.

Enchanting is essentially a crafting skill, infusing a piece of equipment with souls of the slain to power it. The strength of enchantment depends on the power of the soul used to power it, and requires a gem filled with a soul to use with any effect, as well as a certain knowledge of the arcane. There are 6 categories of soul gems: Petty, Lesser, Common, Greater, Grand and Black. Black soul gems don't improve the quality of the enchantment, they just extend its duration

The pettiest enchantments can be created by someone even moderately knowledgeable in the arcane arts, while stronger enchantments require great knowledge and power.

### Mechanics
---
1. When adding an enchantment to an item, you must have an appropriate soul gem (Example: "Absorb health" enchantment restores 1/2/3/4/5 health to the user on a successful hit. If a petty soul gem is used to create it, it heals 1 hp; if a black soul gem is used, it heals 6hp.)

2. You can learn how to apply an enchantment by studying a piece of equipment that already possesses it. Unfortunately, that piece of equipment is destroyed in a process.

3. It takes 7 days per soul category used, starting with petty, to craft an enchanted item. At the end of this period, a caster crafting the item must make an Arcana check: DC 15 for Petty, DC 17 for Lesser, DC 19 for Common, DC 21 for Greater, DC 23 for Grand, or DC 25 for Black soul gem used. If the check fails, the soul gem is wasted with no effect, and caster takes 2d10 points of necrotic damage per soul gem category; this damage can only be healed by finishing a long rest. The caster may take 10 on this check, but not 20.

4. When an item is crafted, it gains a number of charges equal to the Arcana check result; add 10 to the number of charges for each soul gem category above Petty. After these charges are expended, the caster can spend an amount of days, using the same formula as under the previous step; however, the caster automatically succeeds on the Arcana check, and restores an appropriate number of charges to the weapon.

5. You can only use an enchantment once per round, unless stated otherwise. The enchantments of the same type don't stack.
