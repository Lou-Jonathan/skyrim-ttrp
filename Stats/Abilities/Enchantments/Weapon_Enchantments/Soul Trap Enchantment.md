# Soul Trap Enchantment
---
With this enchantment, your weapon gains an ability to drain the power of a soul from you opponent. When you hit a creature that isn't an animal with this weapon, the power of its soul is transferred into an empty soul gem in your possession if the target dies within 6/12/18/24/30 rounds. Weaker souls will fit into larger gems, but stronger souls require stronger soul gems. This ability doesn't actually capture a soul, just a fraction of its power. You can only use this enchantment once per round.
