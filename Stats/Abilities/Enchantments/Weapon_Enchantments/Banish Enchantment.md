# Banish Enchantment
---
This enchantment functions as the spell **banishment**, including the concentration (Spell DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma or intelligence modifier, your choice). When you make a Weapon Attack with a weapon and hit, you can try to send the creature to its native plane. The maximum CR of the creature you can affect depends on the soul gem used in an enchantment: 2/4/6/8/10. You can only use this enchantment once per round.
