A **Human Soul** is a soul type typically associated with sentient humanoid beings. It is often considered more powerful than animal souls but less potent than the souls of mythical or divine entities. In magical contexts, human souls are often sought for their unique essence, capable of powering advanced enchantments or rituals.
