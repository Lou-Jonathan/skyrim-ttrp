# Souls
---
In the world of **Skyrim**, souls are the essence of life and the spark of existence, deeply woven into the fabric of Nirn. Every living creature, from the smallest mudcrab to the mightiest dragon, carries a soul of varying strength. These ethereal forces are sought after by enchanters and mages, who bind them within Soul Gems to fuel powerful magic. Yet, the act of soul trapping is not without moral weightâ€”while the souls of beasts are commonly used, the capture of a sentient soul stirs ethical debates, especially when dealing with the sinister **Black Soul Gems**. To some, a soul is a sacred gift from the Divines; to others, it is a resource waiting to be claimed.
