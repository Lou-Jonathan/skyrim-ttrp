*Your Thu'um freezes an opponent solid.*

You choose an opponent that isn't immune to cold or doesn't have legendary actions within 15 feet away from you. He must make a Constitution saving throw or be frozen solid for the duration. Any amount of damage dealt to the opponent will break the ice and end the effect.
