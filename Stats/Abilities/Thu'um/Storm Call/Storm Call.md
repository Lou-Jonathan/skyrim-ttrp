# Storm call

*A Shout to the skies, a cry to the clouds, that awakens the destructive force of Skyrim's lightning.*

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 100-foot radius, centered on a point 100ft. above you. The shout fails if you can’t see a point of air where the cloud could appear (for example in a room that can’t accommodate the cloud).

When you utter the words of the shout, a bolt of lightning flashes down to a point within the cylinder, targeting a place with the largest number of Tiny or larger creatures. All creatures within 5 feet of the impact must make a Dexterity saving throw or take an appropriate amount of lightning damage.
