Dragon Shouts, also referred to as Shouts or Thu'um in the Dragon language, are an ancient form of magic prominently used in Skyrim during the late Merethic and early First Eras, but has gradually become obscured. Shouts use the vocalization of specific "words of power" to create powerful magical effects, usually for offensive purposes. Each Shout is made up of three words. However, one or two words of a given Shout may be used, but the effect is correspondingly less powerful compared to the full force of the whole shout.

Dragons are able to master and use their Thu'um at will, as this sacred language is their natural language, inborn into their souls from the moment of their creation, (when dragons shout, breathing fire or frost at each other with the Thu'um they are actually having a deadly verbal debate). Mortals are only able to learn and use the Thu'um through a long process of meditation and the practice of the words. There are exceptions to this, these rare individuals are known as Dragonborns, those who are born with the body of a mortal but the soul of a dragon. The Dragonborn is able to intuitively learn Shouts and use them after absorbing the Souls of dragons, and with it the dragon's understanding of the words. As shown during "The Way of the Voice," they can also absorb knowledge from other individuals who have mastered specific words.

A minority of other characters also have the ability to use Dragon Shouts, such as a small group of monks known as the Greybeards, who live in seclusion inside of the fortress of High Hrothgar. This fortress is located near the top of the mountain known as the Throat of the World, which is said to have the highest peak in all of Tamriel. The Greybeards use their Thu'um to meditate, as well as praise and worship the Divines. However, their beliefs differ from the Blades, who believe that the Thu'um should be used as a weapon in the battle against dragons.

Each shout is consisted of 3 words; uttering each word beyond the first carries a greater effect. You can never shout more than once per turn. Once you use a shout, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest; if you used all 3 words, you cannot use it until you finish a long rest instead.

For DMs, I recommend reviewing each shout before allowing/giving them before certain levels, as some are much more powerful than the others (for example, Animal Allegiance is a little bit stronger than a 1st level spell, while Elemental Fury is basically an equivalent of haste, which is a 3rd level spell).

The DC for saving throws against your shouts is: 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier. The power to control the Voice comes from the person's blood and soul.
