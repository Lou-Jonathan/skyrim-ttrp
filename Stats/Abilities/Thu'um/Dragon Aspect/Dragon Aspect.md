# Dragon Aspect
---
*Once a day, take on the mighty aspect of a dragon, delivering colossal blows, with an armored hide, and more powerful shouts.*

This is probably the most powerful shout a player character can obtain. Take great care about giving it out. Additionally, this shout can only be used once a week, no matter the number of words used.

```dataview
table rank as "Rank", meaning as "Meaning"
where shout = "Dragon Aspect" and rank != null
sort rank asc
