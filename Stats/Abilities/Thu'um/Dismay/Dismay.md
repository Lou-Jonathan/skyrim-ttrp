# Dismay
---
*And the weak shall fear the Thu'um, and flee in terror.*

All creatures that aren't immune to fear or have legendary actions caught in the blast must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for the duration.

While Frightened by this shout, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
