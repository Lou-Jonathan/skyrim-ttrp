*Your Thu'um enchants your nearby ally's weapons, allowing them to attack faster.*

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the shout effect ends, it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

```dataview
table rank as "Rank", meaning as "Meaning"
where shout = "Battle Fury" and rank != null
sort rank asc
