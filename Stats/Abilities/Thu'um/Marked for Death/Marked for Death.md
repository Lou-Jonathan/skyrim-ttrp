# Marked for Death
---
*Speak, and let your Voice herald doom, as an opponent's armor is weakened.*

As you shout at an opponent, his armor softens, showing weak spots that can be exploited. Choose one creature within range; the creature must then make a Wisdom saving throw or gain a -2 penalty to Armor Class for the duration.

```dataview
table rank as "Rank", meaning as "Meaning"
where shout = "Marked for Death" and rank != null
sort rank asc
