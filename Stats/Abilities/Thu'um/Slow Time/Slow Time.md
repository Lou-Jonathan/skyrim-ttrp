# Slow time
---
*Shout at time, and command it to obey, as the world around you stands still.*

To other creatures, you become a blur of movement, when really, they are all just too slow.

Until the effect ends, your speed is doubled, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you gains an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

```dataview
table rank as "Rank", meaning as "Meaning"
where shout = "Slow Time" and rank != null
sort rank asc
```
