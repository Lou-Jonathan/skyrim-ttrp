*The Thu'um imbues your arms with the speed of wind, allowing for faster weapon strikes.*

Until the shout effect ends, you gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

```dataview
