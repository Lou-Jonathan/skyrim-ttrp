# Animal Allegiance

This shout lets you convince nearby beasts that you mean them no harm. If the beast’s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beasts must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell’s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.
