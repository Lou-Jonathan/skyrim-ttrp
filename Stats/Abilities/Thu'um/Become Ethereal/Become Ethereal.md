# Become Ethereal

*The Thu'um reaches out to the Void, changing your form to one that cannot harm, or be harmed.*

When you shout, you gain immunity to all kinds of damage, but you can only take the Dash action on each of your turns, and cannot attack or interract with objects and creatures. 

```dataview
table rank as "Rank", meaning as "Meaning"
where shout = "Become Ethereal" and rank != null
sort rank asc
