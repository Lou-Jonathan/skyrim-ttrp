- **Uttering time:** 1 action
- **Range:** self (30-foot cone)
- **Duration:** instantaneous

All creatures in a 30-foot cone in front of you must make a Strength saving throw or be flung to the the end of its reach, landing prone upon landing. If the creature is Huge or larger, or a dragon, it is not flung, but loses its balance and falls prone nevertheless on a failed save.
