# Unrelenting force

*Your Voice is raw power, pushing aside anything - or anyone - who stands in your path.*

All creatures in a cone in front of you must make a Strength saving throw or be flung to the the end of its reach, landing prone upon landing. If the creature is Huge or larger, or a dragon, it is not flung, but loses its balance and falls prone nevertheless on a failed save.
