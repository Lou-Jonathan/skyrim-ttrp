# Wabbajack
---
The **Wabbajack** is not a staff. No, no, no! It’s a _concept_, a _philosophy_, a _cheese-filled nightmare_ given physical form by the Mad God himself, Sheogorath. Legend has it that the Wabbajack was forged in the _Screaming Forge of Unreason_, where the laws of reality are merely suggestions and the anvils are made of screaming butterflies. Its core is said to be powered by the _Essence of Chaos_, a substance so unpredictable that it once turned a historian into a wheel of cheese mid-sentence. The handle is wrapped in the _Hide of Paradox_, which is both infinitely long and impossibly short at the same time.

When wielded, the Wabbajack hums with the _Symphony of Madness_, a tune that only the truly insane can hear—and even then, it sounds like a polka band playing backwards. Its effects are as random as Sheogorath’s mood swings: one moment, it might turn your enemy into a sweetroll; the next, it might summon a herd of flaming goats to chase you in circles. Some say the Wabbajack has a mind of its own, and it enjoys playing pranks on its wielder, like turning their boots into live crabs or their lunch into a sentient, sarcastic potato.

The Wabbajack’s true purpose is unknown, though scholars (who quickly went mad) theorize it was created to “spice up the mundanity of existence.” Sheogorath himself has been quoted as saying, “The Wabbajack isn’t a weapon—it’s a _party invitation_ to the grand ball of chaos! Just don’t be surprised if the punch bowl bites back.”

- **Damage:** `= this.damage`
- **Properties:** `= this.properties`
- **Weight**: `= this.weight` (or 300, depending on its mood)
- **Value**: Priceless (or a single septim, if Sheogorath is feeling generous)

### **Reality’s Plaything**

The **Reality’s Plaything** property means the Wabbajack doesn’t just bend reality—it _tickles it until it giggles uncontrollably_. When activated, the staff warps the fabric of existence, causing localized reality to behave like a drunk bard at a tavern. Gravity might reverse, time could loop in on itself, or the target might suddenly believe they’re a potted plant. The Wabbajack treats the laws of physics as mere suggestions, and the universe is its playground. Wielders often report hearing faint laughter (possibly from Sheogorath himself) after each use, as if the Mad God is watching and enjoying the show.
### _Eternal Cheese Wheel of Infinite Varieties_

Here’s a **d100 table** for the **Chaos Incarnate** property. Roll a d100 whenever the Wabbajack is used to determine the effect:

| Roll  | Effect                                                                                                                                                                         |
