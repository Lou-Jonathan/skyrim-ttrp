The **Orcish Sword** is a weapon forged for battle, designed to be heavy, brutal, and capable of delivering devastating blows. Its crude but effective design makes it a favorite among Orcs and other warriors who prefer raw strength over finesse. The Orcish Sword delivers powerful strikes, especially in the hands of those who rely on force to crush their enemies.
