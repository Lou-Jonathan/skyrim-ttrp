# Daedric Dagger
---
The **Daedric Dagger** is a weapon forged in the chaotic and twisted realms of Oblivion, infused with dark magic and raw power. Its jagged, menacing blade exudes an aura of malevolence, perfect for those who seek to channel the destructive force of the Daedric Princes. Though compact, the Daedric Dagger delivers devastating blows, and its dark power makes it as feared as it is revered by those who dare to wield it.
