# Silver Dagger
---
The **Silver Dagger** is a finely crafted weapon, prized for its effectiveness against the undead and supernatural creatures. Forged from gleaming silver, it is both lightweight and deadly, making it a preferred tool for hunters of vampires, werewolves, and other dark entities. While its blade is not as strong as those made from steel or ebony, its ability to deal extra damage to these creatures makes it invaluable in the right hands.

- **Damage:** 1d4
- **Properties:** Light, Finesse, +1d6 damage against werewolves and undead
