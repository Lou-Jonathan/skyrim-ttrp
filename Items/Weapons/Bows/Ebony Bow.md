The **Ebony Bow** is a weapon of dark elegance, crafted from the rare and deadly ebony wood. Its sleek, jet-black frame radiates an aura of menace, and its arrows fly with unnatural precision and force. The bow's balance and craftsmanship make it a favorite among archers who seek both power and precision in their shots.
