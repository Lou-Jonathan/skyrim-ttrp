# Elven Bow
---
The **Elven Bow** is a weapon of exquisite beauty and deadly precision, crafted by the skilled hands of elven artisans. Its lightweight frame, forged from moonstone and imbued with ancient elven magic, allows for swift and accurate shots. While it may lack the raw power of heavier bows, its grace and balance make it a favorite among archers who value speed and finesse.
