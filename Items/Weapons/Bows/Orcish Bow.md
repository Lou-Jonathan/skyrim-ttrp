# Orcish Bow
---
The **Orcish Bow** is a rugged and powerful weapon, forged by orcish smiths with a focus on raw strength and durability. Its heavy frame and reinforced limbs allow for devastating shots, capable of piercing through armor and flesh with ease. While it may lack the finesse of more refined bows, its sheer power makes it a favorite among warriors who value brute force over precision.
