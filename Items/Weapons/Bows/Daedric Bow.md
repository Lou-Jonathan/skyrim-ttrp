# Daedric Bow
---
The **Daedric Bow** is a weapon of dark power, crafted from ebony and infused with the essence of a Daedra. Its sleek, jagged frame radiates an aura of malevolence, and its arrows fly with unnatural precision and force. Wielded by those who have made pacts with the Daedric Princes, this bow is both a symbol of dread and a tool of annihilation.
