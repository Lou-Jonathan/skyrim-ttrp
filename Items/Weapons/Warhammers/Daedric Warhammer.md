# Daedric Warhammer
---
The **Daedric Warhammer** is a weapon of pure malice, crafted from ebony and infused with the essence of a Daedra. Its massive head and jagged spikes radiate an aura of dread, and its strikes land with the force of a collapsing mountain. Wielded by those who have made pacts with the Daedric Princes, this warhammer is both a symbol of terror and a tool of utter destruction.
