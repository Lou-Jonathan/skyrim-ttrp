# Orcish Warhammer
---
The **Orcish Warhammer** is a brutal and efficient weapon, forged by orcish smiths with a focus on raw power and durability. Its heavy, jagged head is designed to crush through armor and bone with ease, making it a favorite among warriors who value strength over finesse. The weapon's craftsmanship, while rough, is highly effective, and its weight ensures every strike lands with devastating force.
