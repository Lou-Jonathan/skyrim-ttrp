# Ebony Warhammer
---
The **Ebony Warhammer** is a weapon of dark elegance, forged from the rare and deadly ebony metal. Its jet-black head radiates an aura of menace, and its strikes land with devastating force, capable of crushing even the sturdiest defenses. The weapon's unnatural sharpness and balance make it a favorite among those who seek both power and precision in combat.
