# Orcish Greatsword
---
The **Orcish Greatsword** is a brutal and efficient weapon, forged by orcish smiths with a focus on raw power and durability. Its heavy, jagged blade is designed to cleave through armor and flesh with ease, making it a favorite among warriors who value strength over finesse. The weapon's craftsmanship, while rough, is highly effective, and its weight ensures every strike lands with devastating force.
