The **Silver Greatsword** is a finely crafted weapon, forged from gleaming silver and imbued with a sacred aura. While it may not be as durable as steel or as deadly as ebony, its unique properties make it a bane to supernatural creatures like werewolves and undead. Adventurers who face the horrors of the night often carry this weapon, knowing its strikes can pierce the unnatural defenses of their foes.
