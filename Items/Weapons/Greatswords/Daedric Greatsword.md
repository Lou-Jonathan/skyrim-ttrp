# Daedric Greatsword
---
The **Daedric Greatsword** is a weapon of pure malice, crafted from ebony and infused with the essence of a Daedra. Its jagged, serrated blade seems to thirst for blood, and its strikes are unnaturally precise and powerful. Wielded by those who have made pacts with the Daedric Princes, this greatsword is both a symbol of dread and a tool of annihilation. Its unholy power ensures that every critical hit is catastrophic, leaving enemies broken and despairing.
