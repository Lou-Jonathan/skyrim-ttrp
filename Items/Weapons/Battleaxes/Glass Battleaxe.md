The **Glass Battleaxe** is a weapon of stunning beauty and lethal precision, forged from malachite and imbued with advanced elven craftsmanship. Its translucent green blade shimmers in the light, and its razor-sharp edge cuts through armor and flesh with ease. While it may appear fragile, its strength and balance make it a devastating weapon in the hands of a skilled warrior.
