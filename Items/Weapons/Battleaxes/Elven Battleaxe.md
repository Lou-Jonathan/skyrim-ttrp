# Elven Battleaxe
---
The **Elven Battleaxe** is a weapon of exquisite beauty and deadly precision, crafted by the skilled hands of elven smiths. Its blade, forged from moonstone and imbued with ancient elven magic, is both lightweight and razor-sharp. While it may lack the raw power of heavier weapons, its grace and balance make it a favorite among warriors who value speed and finesse.
