# Daedric Battleaxe
---
The **Daedric Battleaxe** is a brutal weapon forged from ebony and infused with the essence of a Daedra. Its jagged blade and menacing design make it a fearsome tool of destruction, capable of cleaving through enemies with unnatural precision. Wielded by those who have made pacts with the Daedric Princes, this battleaxe is both a symbol of dread and a weapon of annihilation.
