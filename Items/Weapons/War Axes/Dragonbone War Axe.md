# Dragonbone War Axe
---
The **Dragonbone War Axe** is a weapon forged from the bones of ancient dragons, imbued with their primal power. Its massive, intimidating blade is both light and impossibly strong, capable of cleaving through even the toughest enemies with ease. A weapon of legend, the Dragonbone War Axe is as fierce as the creatures from which it was made, delivering devastating blows that harness the strength and ferocity of dragons themselves.
