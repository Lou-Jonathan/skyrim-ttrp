The **Silver War Axe** is a rare and enchanted weapon in **Skyrim**, prized for its unique ability to harm undead and supernatural creatures. Crafted from gleaming silver, it is both elegant and deadly, often sought by vampire hunters and those who battle the dark forces of Tamriel. While slightly less durable than steel, its effectiveness against the undead makes it invaluable.
