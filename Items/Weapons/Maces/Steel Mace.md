The **Steel Mace** is a step up from its iron counterpart, crafted from durable steel for increased strength and cutting power. Its heavier head and reinforced shaft make it a formidable weapon in the hands of those who favor brute force. The Steel Mace is a reliable tool for breaking through armor and delivering powerful strikes in battle.
