# Silver Mace

---

The **Silver Mace** is a finely crafted weapon, prized for its ability to deal extra damage to supernatural creatures such as werewolves and undead. Forged from gleaming silver, its blunt force can be just as effective as its sharpness against dark creatures. It is an invaluable weapon for those who hunt the cursed and the undead, blending both elegance and power.
