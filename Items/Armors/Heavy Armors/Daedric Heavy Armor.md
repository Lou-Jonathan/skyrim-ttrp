# Daedric Heavy Armor
---
The **Daedric Heavy Armor** is a terrifying and dark creation, forged from the heart of Oblivion itself. Made from a rare, otherworldly material that seems to pulse with an eerie, arcane energy, this armor is both a symbol of power and fear. It provides exceptional protection against physical and magical attacks, with the added advantage of immunity to critical hits. Wearing Daedric armor marks the wearer as a formidable force, often striking fear into the hearts of enemies before the battle even begins.
