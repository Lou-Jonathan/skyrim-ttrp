The **Steel Heavy Armor** is a hallmark of skilled blacksmithing, offering reliable protection for those who demand more durability in combat. Favored by guards and mercenaries, its reinforced structure requires a modest level of strength to wear effectively. While heavier than iron, it provides superior defense, making it a popular choice for warriors venturing into dangerous lands.
