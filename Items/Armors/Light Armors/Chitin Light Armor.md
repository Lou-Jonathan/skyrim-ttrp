# Chitin Light Armor
---
The **Chitin Light Armor** is crafted from the hardened exoskeletons of giant insects, making it both lightweight and durable. Its unusual material offers a unique combination of protection and flexibility, though the armor’s design restricts dexterity to some extent. It is popular among those who frequent the dangerous, insect-infested regions of Tamriel, providing reliable defense while still allowing for swift movement. The chitin armor’s natural armor properties make it ideal for those who seek to blend utility with protection.
