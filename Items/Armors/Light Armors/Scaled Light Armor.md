# Scaled Light Armor
---
The **Scaled Light Armor** is a hybrid design that combines lightweight scales with flexible leather, offering a balanced mix of protection and mobility. While heavier than other light armors, it still provides excellent defense while allowing for moderate movement. It’s often favored by those who need stronger protection than basic leather but don’t want to be weighed down by heavy armor. The distinct pattern of scales offers both style and function, making it a popular choice among warriors and mercenaries.
