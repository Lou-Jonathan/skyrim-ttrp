# Hide Light Armor
---
The **Hide Light Armor** is crafted from the pelts of wild beasts, offering a blend of natural protection and flexibility. This armor is favored by hunters and those who live off the land, providing solid defense against environmental dangers while still allowing the wearer to move swiftly. While it is not as durable as more refined armors, its rugged, natural materials make it a reliable choice for those in need of basic protection.
