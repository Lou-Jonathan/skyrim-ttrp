## Info
---
The **Sleeping Giant Inn** is a small [inn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Inns "Skyrim:Inns") and tavern in the town of [Riverwood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Riverwood). It is the first building on the left-hand side coming from Whiterun.

[Orgnar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Orgnar "Skyrim:Orgnar") is the innkeeper, selling food as well as several alchemy [ingredients](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ingredients "Skyrim:Ingredients"), which can be used at the [alchemy lab](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alchemy_Lab "Skyrim:Alchemy Lab") in the corner by the door. Rooms are normally rented from [Delphine](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Delphine "Skyrim:Delphine"). However, when Delphine is traveling elsewhere, Orgnar will rent you a room, even though his dialogue still tells you to talk to Delphine.
