## Info
---
Helgen is a town in eastern Falkreath Hold.

Helgen after the dragon attack
It is the location where you begin the game, as you are transported there to be executed. Largely run by the Imperial military, the town features several fortified towers and buildings. Shortly after your arrival, the settlement comes under attack by the ancient dragon Alduin, and you are forced to escape through Helgen Keep.

If you return to the town after visiting Whiterun, the ruins will be inhabited by a group of bandits.
